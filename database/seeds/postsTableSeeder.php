Decreasing food miles helps protect our environment by using less fuel and packaging.  2)  Provides you with foods which contain more nutrients. Fresh food from local farms don't spend days in trucks and on store shelves losing nutrients. They taste better too!  3) Buying local foods supports the small farmer and supports our local <span class=\"bodytext\">communities.   <span class=\"bodytext\"> If you are interested in finding about more ways to buy locally visit \" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foodroutes.org\/localfood\/\" target=\"_blank\">food routes<\/a> \" where you can find out about restaurants, grocery stores, and farmer's markets which sell local foods in Missouri.    <\/p>",

Act II Popcorn sells their popcorn in Halloween popcorn balls.&nbsp; Each popcorn ball contains 100 calories.&nbsp;Popcorn is a whole-grain food and contains fiber.

As the nights get colder, there is nothing better than some good hot cocoa with marshmallows or whipped cream.&nbsp; Many hot cocoa packets run anywhere from 35-100 calories per packet.

Feeling confident that I make my own food choices based on my nutritional knowledge of&nbsp;food along with food costs, I started to question those clever food marketers and their ability to influence my purchasing habits.  Lets start with color. Take for example, the golden McDonald's arch, the red and white tablecloth&nbsp;in the pizza parlor, or the color of your Coke can.&nbsp; Colors such as red, oranges, violet, and deep greens stimulate hunger. If you notice, reds and yellows color the packages on the grocery shelves and in fast food restaurants.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Want to eat less at your holiday dinner? Use a blue tablecloth. The color blue suppresses appetite. In addition, we don't eat a lot of blue foods, unless you are a bubble gum ice cream eater.  What about wording on packages? Take the word \"natural.\" Consumers love to buy things that are \"natural\".&nbsp; However, \"natural\" has no meaning in law or in regulation.&nbsp; It does not mean that the food is organic or that it has less calories, fat, or sugar than its unnatural counterpart. In addition, some \"natural\" foods do harm, such as the&nbsp;\"natural\"&nbsp;poisionous mushroom, which hopefully you can't find in the store.  Finally, cost. The&nbsp;sale price of an item might easily persuade someone to veer from their regular purchased food item without thinking twice. &nbsp;I definitely tend to grab the \"buy one, get one free\" or sale item. However, without checking out the cost per unit, you might actually be missing out on the cheaper item.  So if you are running to the grocery store to pick up a quick dinner item, think about your choices.

I have Hershey's kisses to the left of my computer, a Cadbury Ornament Creme Egg on the right, and to inspire the blog, I am sipping on a cup of hot chocolate.  The chocolates surrounding me are milk chocolate and unfortunately don't provide many health benefits other than benefiting my tastebuds, BUT...I am happy to tell you that certain types of chocolate can actually offer a multitude of benefits pertaining to disease prevention.&nbsp; Just a small taste of these health benefits include:  Improved heart health (decreases the \"little devils or LDL\"),  Lowered risk for certain types of cancer,  Improved blood pressure, and  Increased alertness (1 oz contains ~18mg caffeine).  So, is my&nbsp;Cadbury Creme Egg as good as Hershey's Dark Chocolate? Sorry delicious super sweet egg, but I can't call you healthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;  To achieve maximum health benefits,&nbsp;one needs to choose \"bittersweet\" or \"semisweet\" chocolate.&nbsp; These chocolates contain ~70% cocoa solids and less&nbsp;sugar.&nbsp; The darker the chocolate, typically, the higher amount of antioxidants.&nbsp; The&nbsp;type of antioxidants in chocolate are&nbsp;similar to those&nbsp;found in other foods such as tea, red wine, or colorful fruits and vegetables like blueberries.  Now the real question...how much chocolate am I excused to eat a day? The current recommendation is 1 oz a day, but it can be everyday! One ounce contains 136 calories, 1.19 g protein, 8.5 g fat, 9 mg Calcium, 33 mg Magnesium, 103 mg Potassium. All necessary vitamins and minerals!

                        "content" => "<p> A couple of weeks ago, one of my fellow bloggers asked me to write about eating healthy on a college budget. While eating healthy might seem difficult to do on a college student's income, many of my adult (employed) clients also complain that it is too expensive to eat healthy. However, I am here to share a few tips on eating healthy on a limited budget.  <strong>Cut Back on Protein (Meat Sources)<\/strong> A common misconception many Americans hold is the amount of protein one needs. Most of us get way more protein in our diets than is required. In addition, many think the best source of protein is animal protein.  If you take a look at your grocery bill, you might find that protein is the most expensive.  Therefore, a first step would be to decrease the portion sizes of animal protein in your diet and increase calories from healthy grains such as brown rice or oats. In addition, choosing more \"meatless\" sources of protein like beans, nuts or soy can be an excellent way to cut costs as well as get more fiber and less saturated fat in your diet.  If you have a freezer, buying protein in bulk, such as the large bags of chicken-breast or turkey-breast cutlets can save you money. You can buy a bag of chicken breasts, which should feed you for at least a month, at Sam's Club for for less than $10 a bag.  Canned tuna is another lean, healthy source of protein. If you are concerned about the mercury content in tuna fish, choose \"light\" tuna over \"white\" or albacore tuna. Light tuna comes from a smaller tuna fish, and therefore contains less mercury and is just as nutritious.  Peanut butter is another great source of inexpensive protein. Don't worry about buying reduced-fat peanut butter. It typically is more expensive, and the type of fat in peanut butter is heart-healthy.  Reduced-fat peanut butter tends to contain more sugar as well. <strong>Get Grainy<\/strong> If your bread products tend to mold fast, store them in your freezer to make them last longer.  In addition, buy grains that can be more versatile than bread. For example, tortillas can be used to wrap veggie pizza ingredients, tuna fish salad, egg salad, beans and cheese, etc. I didn't do my research to see if crockpots or slow cookers are an \"allowed\" electronic device in the residence halls...but the crockpot can be a great cooking tool for anyone. Toss together brown rice, black beans, tomatoes, green chilies, broth-based soup and spices and voila...with a couple of 50-cent canned goods, you've created a meal for a week. <strong>Eat Your Fruits and Veggies<\/strong> I can't write a blog without mentioning my two favorite food groups! When it comes to purchasing fruits, it is usually cheaper to buy them in bulk bags if possible. If you don't feel you can eat them in a timely manner, share the fruit with other dorm friends and then you can take turns purchasing them. When it comes to purchasing vegetables, buy the frozen bags of veggies. Sometimes you can find them on sale for less than $1 per bag, and frozen veggies are just as nutritious. Pop them into your crockpot of soup and increase your veggies for the day. <strong>On Sale Snacks<\/strong> Healthy snacks such as string cheese, yogurt or granola bars are sometimes pretty expensive. However, it is pretty common to find at least one brand of each of these types of snacks on sale at any given time. In particular, look for the generic brands.  Generic brands are just as nutritious as name-brand items. Compare the cost per unit to get an idea of savings between products. <strong>Make a Request from Home...<\/strong> One thing I never forgot to do in college was to raid my parents' freezer or pantry for canned goods or frozen items that would last until they reached my dorm or apartment. A great tip I read last week was to have mom bake her meatloaf or meat \"ball\" type of casserole in a muffin tin. This makes it easy to use a little at a time for  marinara sauce, form into a hamburger patty  or throw into a casserole dish with some rice.  There are many more tips on the Web, but I hope at least one of my tips will find its way to your belly! <\/p>",

                        "content" => "<p> My favorite spectator sport is coming to an end, but at least we all get to celebrate it with a party! In doing&nbsp;some research for this blog, I&nbsp;realized that&nbsp;Super Bowl Sunday ranks 2nd (after Thanksgiving) in the amount of calories\/day consumed by Americans! I had no idea! I guess it does makes sense...for instance,  1) we are&nbsp;surrounded by food and&nbsp;drink for more&nbsp;than ~6 hours  2) touchdowns by the opposing team can cause emotional eaters to eat more  3) we have a hard time leaving our couch potato position&nbsp;so we don't miss the commercials  For those of who might be interested in a Super Bowl meal make-over,&nbsp;I have a couple of ideas...  1) <strong>Chili:<\/strong> Chili,&nbsp;chocked full with beans, tomatoes and other vegetables is an excellent health food! Leaving out the meat or using lean ground beef, lean turkey breast or soy crumbles can decrease overall calories and saturated fat. I think it is a good idea to start with chili as an appetizer. The beans and vegetables in chili are very satisfying and filling, and it just might be a good strategy to tame our linebacker appetites.  2) <strong>Hot Wings:<\/strong> Some might find this idea far from their beloved chicken wings, but try dipping chicken breast tenders in buttermilk or egg whites and then coating them in a plastic bag with crushed breakfast cereal (cornflakes) and spices. Bake the chicken tenders and offer up sauces like wing sauce, BBQ sauce, or honey mustard.  3) <strong>Tater Skins:<\/strong> Top potato skins with light cheese, salsa and avocado instead of bacon and sour cream. Your baked taters are an excellent source of calcium, vitamin C, and potassium. Plus they are filling.  4) <strong>Pizza:<\/strong> If you are ordering out pizza, choose thin crust and leaner meats like&nbsp;Canadian bacon or chicken.&nbsp; If you are making a pizza at home, you can buy pre-made whole wheat crusts (such &nbsp;as Boboli), use&nbsp;light cheese, and add your some veggies (marinated artichoke hearts and roasted red bell peppers are some of my favorites).  5) <strong>Dips:<\/strong> Add refried black beans or hummus to cheese dips to increase fiber and reduce calories. Offer vegetable trays, baked chips, pita bread, or&nbsp;pretzels to dip instead of regular tortilla or potato chips.  No matter what you choose to&nbsp;eat or&nbsp;what team you are rooting for, I hope you enjoy the day and the commercials!

In doing&nbsp;some research for this blog, I&nbsp;realized that&nbsp;Super Bowl Sunday ranks 2nd (after Thanksgiving) in the amount of calories\/day consumed by Americans! I had no idea! I guess it does makes sense...for instance,  1) we are&nbsp;surrounded by food and&nbsp;drink for more&nbsp;than ~6 hours  2) touchdowns by the opposing team can cause emotional eaters to eat more  3) we have a hard time leaving our couch potato position&nbsp;so we don't miss the commercials  For those of who might be interested in a Super Bowl meal make-over,&nbsp;I have a couple of ideas...  1) Chili: Chili,&nbsp;chocked full with beans, tomatoes and other vegetables is an excellent health food! Leaving out the meat or using lean ground beef, lean turkey breast or soy crumbles can decrease overall calories and saturated fat. I think it is a good idea to start with chili as an appetizer. The beans and vegetables in chili are very satisfying and filling, and it just might be a good strategy to tame our linebacker appetites.  2) Hot Wings: Some might find this idea far from their beloved chicken wings, but try dipping chicken breast tenders in buttermilk or egg whites and then coating them in a plastic bag with crushed breakfast cereal (cornflakes) and spices. Bake the chicken tenders and offer up sauces like wing sauce, BBQ sauce, or honey mustard.  3) Tater Skins: Top potato skins with light cheese, salsa and avocado instead of bacon and sour cream. Your baked taters are an excellent source of calcium, vitamin C, and potassium. Plus they are filling.  4) Pizza: If you are ordering out pizza, choose thin crust and leaner meats like&nbsp;Canadian bacon or chicken.&nbsp; If you are making a pizza at home, you can buy pre-made whole wheat crusts (such &nbsp;as Boboli), use&nbsp;light cheese, and add your some veggies (marinated artichoke hearts and roasted red bell peppers are some of my favorites).  5) Dips: Add refried black beans or hummus to cheese dips to increase fiber and reduce calories. Offer vegetable trays, baked chips, pita bread, or&nbsp;pretzels to dip instead of regular tortilla or potato chips.  No matter what you choose to&nbsp;eat or&nbsp;what team you are rooting for, I hope you enjoy the day and the commercials! Maybe the commericals will be really funny, laughing is not only good for the soul but burns calories too (:",

Unfortunately,&nbsp;we are not fully informed when it comes to getting accurate information on food labels. Manufacturers are able to use the \"round-down law\" which allows companies like Nestle to put <strong>10 calories per&nbsp;teaspoon<\/strong> on their food label instead of the actual <strong>14.83 calories per teaspoon<\/strong> of Coffee-mate powder.

So you might think, big deal, that is only 15 calories...The calories aren't the only misleading piece of information, the amount and type of fats can be misleading as well.  Let's look at trans-fats. The recommended&nbsp;amount of&nbsp;trans-fats (the bad fats&nbsp;that increase bad cholesterol and decrease good cholesterol) per day should be less than 2 grams (health professionals really would like to recommend&nbsp;\"0\").&nbsp; However, if a product contains less than 1 gram of trans-fats, the food manufacturer can legally put \"0\" on the label.  Now to critcally analzye the creamer in my refrigerator door at home-CoffeeMate liquid hazelnut.&nbsp;&nbsp;On its nutrition label, it&nbsp;states 0 trans-fats, but as the article I read today uncovered, it&nbsp;actually contains 0.31 grams of trans fats.&nbsp; For an individual who drinks three 12-oz mugs of coffee&nbsp;a day and adds 2 tablespoons of creamer, he or she would be consuming 2.76 grams of trans-fats (more than a day's worth of trans-fats).  Another thing that might slide right past you is the serving size. The serving size listed on the nutrition label is typically 2 TEASPOONS, not 2 Tablespoons. I don't know many individuals who use less than&nbsp; 2 teaspoons of creamer in their coffee. That minute amount of cream doesn't give you a \"creamy\" look at all!  So what is the coffee lover supposed to do? First of all, look at the \"ingredient list.\" If you spot the words \"partially hydrogenated\" you can be sure it does contain trans-fats. In addition, look for alternative creamers such as Land O' Lakes fat-free half and half. It contains only 20 calories in 2 Tablespoons and contains 0.3 grams saturated fats and 0 grams of trans fats.  You could also select some other \"healthier\" creamers like the International Delight Fat-Free which contains 60 calories in two Tablespoons with no fat, saturated fat, or trans fats.  Don't forget about good old milk. Even 2 Tablespoons of whole milk contain less calories, saturated fat and trans fats than the misleading creamers. <\/p>",

In fact, I often find myself \"taking in the scenery,\" and taking my time.&nbsp; But, I don't like getting passed, I admit to my competitive bone. So I asked myself, how could she be so much faster? For starters, she was on a road bike and I was on May, my&nbsp;hybrid. She also was wearing the \"biking garb\" compared to my non-ergo-dynamic old college jersey shorts and t-shirt.&nbsp; She had a shiny sleek helmet, versus my cracked, rounded one.&nbsp;  But sensibly, I finally came to the conclusion, that most likely she a) probably trains more b)&nbsp;trains harder&nbsp;c) is genetically gifted.  I did however, make some adjustments to my diet in case I see her on the way home.&nbsp; I drank more&nbsp;water.&nbsp;I realized that I had not been following my typical hydration routine. Water&nbsp;has numerous vital roles in maintaining our optimal health. Regarding&nbsp;physical performance,&nbsp;a 1-2% reduction in body weight due to&nbsp;dehydration can significantly impair&nbsp;your morning jog or afternoon bike ride home. This dehydrated state causes your blood volume to drop and makes&nbsp;your heart work harder to&nbsp;move blood through your body.  So how much water does one need? Honestly, I can't give you an exact answer. You are unique. You sweat differently, you lose water differently, and the length and intensity of your exercise differs from everyone else. SO, finding the right amount varies.  I do have two easy ways to know whether or not you are hydrating properly. 1) Check out the the output and color of your urine. If you urine smells, is&nbsp; yellow to dark in color, and is little in regard to volume: you need to drink more water.  2) Weigh yourself (naked-sweaty clothes after exercise will weigh more) before and after exercise. If you weigh less after exercise, you did not hydrate well enough during the exercise, if you weigh more, you over-hydrated (which can also be a bad thing). If you are about the same weight, guess what? yes, you did a good job.  Some rules of thumb for hydrating during exercise.  1) Drink about 2-3 cups, 2-3 hours prior to exercise, &amp; top it off with one more cup of water 10-15 minutes prior to exercise.  2) During exercise, drink 1 cup every 10-15 minutes. I realize this may be difficult depending on the circumstances...  3) After exercise: If you lost weight, drink 20-24 oz of water for every 1# lost.  4) For exercise lasting 90 minutes or longer (for some 60 minutes depending on the intensity and weather) incorporate carbohydrate into your beverage (ie Gatorade or Powerade).  Happy exercising, and if you find yourself passing me on your bike at least say hello (: <\/p>",

If you urine smells, is&nbsp; yellow to dark in color, and is little in regard to volume: you need to drink more water.  2) Weigh yourself (naked-sweaty clothes after exercise will weigh more) before and after exercise. If you weigh less after exercise, you did not hydrate well enough during the exercise, if you weigh more, you over-hydrated (which can also be a bad thing). If you are about the same weight, guess what? yes, you did a good job.  Some rules of thumb for hydrating during exercise.  1) Drink about 2-3 cups, 2-3 hours prior to exercise, &amp; top it off with one more cup of water 10-15 minutes prior to exercise.  2) During exercise, drink 1 cup every 10-15 minutes. I realize this may be difficult depending on the circumstances...  3) After exercise: If you lost weight, drink 20-24 oz of water for every 1# lost.  4) For exercise lasting 90 minutes or longer (for some 60 minutes depending on the intensity and weather) incorporate carbohydrate into your beverage (ie Gatorade or Powerade).  Happy exercising, and if you find yourself passing me on your bike at least say hello (:",

Breakfast: rinsed down a multi-vitamin pill with enriched orange juice. Ate a bowl of fortified cereal, with vitamin-D fortified soy milk.  Snack: A quick, energy nutrition bar  Lunch: A calcium-fortified soup, with iron-enriched bread  Snack: vitamin-C enriched fruit leather, and a multivitamin fortified yogurt.  and the day continued a less&nbsp;un-enriched and un-fortified foods...  Many of the foods she chose to eat are categorized as \"functional foods.\" There is no true definition of a functional food, but basically it is any food or dietary component that may provide a health benefit beyond basic nutrition.&nbsp;  A fortified food has had nutrients added that were not naturally found in the food.  An enriched food means adding back nutrients that were lost in the processing.  So should we all be eating functional foods? The answer is maybe. In all actuality, many of&nbsp;us consume these foods without making a conscious decision to do so.  It is ironic, that in a country which offers a plethora of a variety of foods, that the market continues to grow with&nbsp;enriched and fortified versions of food. In addition, we also have a plethora of foods which lack nutrients, are&nbsp;highly-refined,&nbsp;and are calorie-dense.&nbsp;A diet high in these foods could lead to lower levels of important micronutrients such as vitamin A, C, and E; calcium, magnesium; and potassium. Researchers are also finding out that we might need more of certain nutrients than currently recommended, like vitamin D.  So maybe some of these foods can help? Yes, functional foods may offer some benefit to those who don't meet their nutritional needs.  But, we can also get too much of a good thing. In addition, getting these micronutrients from superfoods (mentioned in the last blog), might be an even better answer. Whole foods, such as blueberries,&nbsp; contain potential phytochemicals that we haven't even begun to identify, and nutrients in foods work synergistically to improve health.  There is also a concern with OD-ing on these products. Iron, for example, is one of the most overdosed mineral in a child's diet. There is also a potential for getting too much vitamin A. The upper limit for&nbsp;vitamin&nbsp;A is 10,000 International Units (IU) &nbsp;and too much vitamin A can actually become toxic at levels of 25,000 IU.  So what recommendations to my friend about her diet did I offer other than a reminder&nbsp;that my services aren't free?&nbsp;(:  We discussed the fact that the micronutrients in the individual functional foods she consumed each only met ~10-25% of the daily value she needed for a day.&nbsp; Therefore, there was little concern she was going to induce any toxicity. I also brought to her attention the higher costs associated with many of the functional foods and how she might get more bang for her buck both nutritionally and financially by shopping at the farmer's market on Saturday. The take home lesson <em>once again<\/em> was eating in a manner of balance, moderation, and variety! <\/p>",

In all actuality, many of&nbsp;us consume these foods without making a conscious decision to do so.  It is ironic, that in a country which offers a plethora of a variety of foods, that the market continues to grow with&nbsp;enriched and fortified versions of food. In addition, we also have a plethora of foods which lack nutrients, are&nbsp;highly-refined,&nbsp;and are calorie-dense.&nbsp;A diet high in these foods could lead to lower levels of important micronutrients such as vitamin A, C, and E; calcium, magnesium; and potassium. Researchers are also finding out that we might need more of certain nutrients than currently recommended, like vitamin D.  So maybe some of these foods can help? Yes, functional foods may offer some benefit to those who don't meet their nutritional needs.  But, we can also get too much of a good thing. In addition, getting these micronutrients from superfoods (mentioned in the last blog), might be an even better answer. Whole foods, such as blueberries,&nbsp; contain potential phytochemicals that we haven't even begun to identify, and nutrients in foods work synergistically to improve health.  There is also a concern with OD-ing on these products. Iron, for example, is one of the most overdosed mineral in a child's diet. There is also a potential for getting too much vitamin A. The upper limit for&nbsp;vitamin&nbsp;A is 10,000 International Units (IU) &nbsp;and too much vitamin A can actually become toxic at levels of 25,000 IU.  So what recommendations to my friend about her diet did I offer other than a reminder&nbsp;that my services aren't free?&nbsp;(:  We discussed the fact that the micronutrients in the individual functional foods she consumed each only met ~10-25% of the daily value she needed for a day.&nbsp; Therefore, there was little concern she was going to induce any toxicity. I also brought to her attention the higher costs associated with many of the functional foods and how she might get more bang for her buck both nutritionally and financially by shopping at the farmer's market on Saturday. The take home lesson once again was eating in a manner of balance, moderation, and variety!",

If you are like me and most of my nutrition clients, your weekend habits are probably different as well.  So, I will only confess, for now, a weekday.  I included some brand names and calories so you can decide for yourself if you are interested in ever checking out something on the list. (:  <strong>Breakfast:  6am<\/strong> 1 Trader Joes Mango and Berry Bran Muffin:  240 calories, a lot of fiber. I believe it contains 8 grams of fiber or more. I love these muffins because they are filling, contain real hunks of mango, and of course, taste good.  1 TBSP peanut butter. Breakfast is not breakfast to me unless it contains peanut butter. It is my favorite food. The PB went on the TJ muffin.  Calories: 100, good source of monounsaturated fat.  Little bit of Sugar-free syrup. Sugar-free syrup contains 35 calories per 1\/4 cup and real maple syrup contains 200 calories in 1\/4 a cup. Yes, I know it contains artificial sweeteners. I am not concerned with these sweeteners in the small amount that I use them. Research still shows that in moderation they are considered safe.  10 calories, the artificial sweetener used in this product is called Splenda or sucralose.  Still eating... <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seeveggiesdifferently.com\/\">Morningstar<\/a> Soy Sausage Breakfast Patty: 80 calories. I love morningstar soy products. They have great black bean burgers, and other tasty soy products as well.  Coffee. One of our favorite wedding gifts so far was a coffeemaker from William Sonoma, it grinds the beans, filters the water, and no fail, makes a perfect cup of coffee. I put 1 pack of Splenda, and 2Tbsp fat free half and half in my coffee. 20 calories.  Breakfast Grand Total: 450 calories. Perfect. I shoot for somewhere around 500. <strong>SNACK: 9am<\/strong> Low-fat Jarlsberg (swiss) cheese. Time for a calcium food. I get this cheese at a reasonable price from Trader Joe's, it doesn't taste low-fat and it is 50 calories. <strong>LUNCH: 11am<\/strong> (If I can hold out that long...)  Egg Sandwich: Thomas Whole-Wheat English Muffin (120 calories), 1 egg (75 calories), 1 slice low-fat Jarlsberg cheese (50 calories).  This morning, I was in a hurry and had to pack fast. Once again, another wedding present comes to the rescue. The Egg McMuffin maker machine. It toasts your bread, hard boils your egg, and cooks the ham all at the same time! I leave off the ham.  Calories: 245  Carrots: I don't buy the baby carrots. More often than not, they are slimey and don't taste as sweet. Two hand-peeled carrots (no machine needed) ~35 calories  Apple: Apples are one of my favorite fruits. They are satisfying, filling, and aren't messy. It is also almost <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eckerts.com\/apple.htm\">apple season<\/a> , and now is the time to buy!  80 calories.  Miniature Dark chocolate with peanuts.  I enjoy sweets, especially dark chocolate. 30 calories.  Diet Coke: caffeine pick me up after lunch. 0 calories.  Grand Lunch Total: 390 calories <strong>SNACK 2pm<\/strong> :  Whole-wheat tortilla (120 calories) with a little less than 1 Tbsp peanut butter (80 calories).   Tortillas are so versatile. I find this snack easy to transport and also incorporates my fav food, peanut butter.  Calories: 200 <strong>Dinner: 6pm<\/strong> Red Pepper Pasta (200 calories) with \"homemade\" marinara sauce (160 calories). The sauce literally took 15 minutes. I started out with garlic, red wine, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil. To that I added tempeh (a meaty, fermented soy food), cut up tomatoes, mushrooms, kale (my favorite leafy green) and Tony's Jarred Mariana Sauce.  I had a side of yellow squash (50 calories) with rooster sauce (it is a hot sauce).  I have to say, this meal so far was my best. It was jammed pack with vitamins and minerals:  A meal other dietitians would be impressed with.  Calories: 430 calories <strong>SNACK: 8pm<\/strong> 1 Van's Belgium waffle (100 calories) with a touch of cinnamon and whipped cream (50 calories) . Van's waffles can be found in the \"healthy\" freezer section at the grocery. I choose these waffles over others for their fiber content and taste.  1 low-fat hot chocolate with cool-whip (150 calories).  Yum.

As part of their exam they presented beautifully plated pastries such as the butternut squash creme bruelee, flourless chocolate cake, and poached apple &amp; pumpkin spiced pudding. It was delish.  Yesterday, our Graduate Students presented their \"nutrition assessment\" projects while we the evaluating faculty enjoyed wine and cheese offered by the course's professor.  Today at lunch, two of our Dietetic Internship students dropped off a cranberry bread pudding that they had prepared last night for cooking demonstration.  And you thought that you had it tough with the seemingly endless food celebrations at your office!  As I researched this \"weight gain in the office\" topic, I found a statistic that stated that those who have sedentary jobs and sit for 6 hours or more are at least 2x as likely to be overweight than those who sit for 45 minutes or less at their jobs. It makes sense! An office environment can provide many pitfalls for those who are trying to stay in shape.  To avoid being part of that terrible statistic, I realized, I must hold true and strong to a couple of my current strategies.  I never miss a meal. I really can't remember the last time I did. I am not for sure if that is somehting to be proud of or not, but what I do know is that it allows me to never get really really hungry. Some people work through lunch and don't even realize it, others skip it intentinolly to get more work done. But do you really get more work done by skipping a 15 minute lunch? That lunch provides us energy to get through the rest of the day at work, it gives us a chance to take a mental break from our work and come back to our desk refreshed and mentally energized.  I try to get up and move. I actually sit on a stability ball at work. I initially decided to do this so it would be a constant reminder to sit up straight. I definitely catch myself slouching, but one unbalanced movement on the stability ball reminds me to tighten up that core and pull back those shoulders. In addition, I try to get up and walk around at least once a hour, drinking lots of water helps...if you know what I mean. (:  A quick walking break gets my blood pumping and improves my alertness.  I bring my lunch. Yes, Fresh Gatherings Cafe, our nutrition and dietetics student run cafe, has the best food on campus. However, I usually save both calories and money when I bring my lunch from home.  As I put away my dinner, most of the time I pack the leftovers for lunch. It is important though, that if you pack your lunch, it is something that you look forward to eating! Easy ways to spice up the brown bagged lunch is try and new and flavorful condiment, instead of the yellow boring mustard, try a spicy hot horseradish mustard.  Swap out some whole wheat pita for your sandwich bread. Use last night's grilled salmon instead of tunafish for your salad sandwich filling.  I have learned to just say no. It gets easier as you go. Unfortunately, as much as I wished I could, I just can't and shouldn't eat it all. If I know we have a department party or a pastry exam, I make room for it in my caloric daily budget, or...I go over my budget. However, for all those unexpected break room goodies, I do my best to say, maybe next time.  I have healthy friends. My next door \"office neighbor\" has healthier habits than I do. He snacks on figs and almonds, eats 2-3 apples a day, and never fails to not ride his bike into work..Even on 20 degree days. In addition, he'll keep me abreast of running or biking events around town. We all need someone like this in our life, someone who keeps us on our toes and challenges us, and, if you are lucky enough like me, you can find this friend at work.  Maybe you have to be that person to someone else?  Encouraging others to partner up with you and bring healthy foods to your office potlucks or to meet you at lunch for a walk? What a great and fun way to stay on track.  So get up and take a quick break! You and your work deserve it. <\/p>",

I tend to incorrectly assume that people know what a \"marathon\" is, but for individuals who aren't into running, a marathon is&nbsp;a race (usually road race) that lasts 26.2 miles. I am not for sure I would say I actually \"race\" it.&nbsp; So when you hear someone talk about a half marathon that is equal to 13.1 miles. My first marathon was on my 22nd birthday in my hometown of Nashville.&nbsp;This marathon will be the day before my 31st birthday.&nbsp; Over those 8 years, I have run a total of 4 marathons. It&nbsp;seems all my body&nbsp;can handle is one every other year,&nbsp;but there are people who run several marathons a year.  Each one of my marathons conjure up special,&nbsp;unique (and painful-some more than others) memories. People run these crazy distances for numerous reasons.&nbsp; I actually&nbsp;have a framed poster in my office that I bought at the Boston marathon in 2007 that lists personal reasons of why a person takes on the marathon, a couple of them are as follows:  \"The Best, Worst, Hardest, Happiest 26.2 miles of your life.\"  \"My boyfriend said I'm afraid of commitment. So I had to prove him wrong.\"  \"The road is my therapist.\"  My quote on the Boston wall (but didn't make the final poster cut), was that \"there is no other feeling like starting and&nbsp;finishing a marathon.\" &nbsp;Even as I write this blog, I get a lump in my throat of the dedication and determination it takes to finish this&nbsp;event.  The training is tough, and especially training over the winter season for a spring marathon- we are training for the Big Sur Marathon, CA in April. I won't forget the 17 mile day, when I was training for another spring marathon and ran in Forest Park in the pouring sleet for 12 miles, and then finished the last 5 miles on a treadmill in a small claustrophobic workout room at my first apartment complex.&nbsp;  To train for a marathon with my husband is very special. As I have trained with others in the past, I am aware of the nuances that you pick up after running with someone for 3 hours. Maybe they (or I)&nbsp;complain too much, or want to stop for water at every&nbsp;water break, and then, consequently, &nbsp;stop at every restroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, more importantly, you realize that they are also supportive, committed, and strong.&nbsp; You learn a lot about someone on those long runs, and I look forward to sharing that with PJ. For our first couple of weeks, I have consciously tried not to disseminate too much advice or start sentences with \"in my past marathon experience...\". I do realize that this is an individual commitment, and we will both go through some tough training times and unfortunately or fortunately, they won't happen for us at the same time.  I wanted to share my goal today in this blog, because I feel that when we set goals, no matter what size, we should share them with others. The more people that know about our commitments, the more likely we are to follow through with them and benefit from other's support.  If you are interested in trying your first marathon, I highly recommend following <a title=\"marathon training program \" href=\"http:\/\/www.halhigdon.com\/\">Hal Higdon<\/a> 's training programs. He offers programs at every level and also educates you on why the training program is set up as it is.

Is it the 35 papers I have sitting in front of me to grade?  Or is it the gloomy, cloudy winter day that makes it seem the spring flowers will never arrive?  Most likely, it is a combination of the three.  On a more rational note, it could be the fact that I haven't had my full dose of the sunshine vitamin \"D\" in awhile.  With the abundance of food in our environment, it seems rare that Americans are \"deficient\" in a nutrient(s),  however, recent statistics show that over half adults and children might be deficient in vitamin D.  Vitamin D is important for several health reasons, but is most known for its role in bone health, <strong>mood<\/strong> , and most recently has been in the spotlight for its role in heart disease prevention.  Vitamin D is so vital actually, that our bodies make it on their own when exposed to sunlight.  Five to 30 minutes about twice a week (without sunscreen) to your face and arms is usually enough for most individuals.  But what about in these long winter days? Research shows that our blood levels of vitamin D might be lower during the winter months than in the warm summer. In addition, those who live in northern latitudes,  those with dark skin, and those that do not get outside are even at higher risk for a \"D\" deficiency.  In addition to the lack of sunlight, vitamin D is not surprisingly found in many foods. Salmon and other fatty fish like tuna are naturally rich in the sunshine vitamin. Fortified foods like milk, cereals, and orange juice can be good sources as well because Vitamin D has been added.  So how do I get enough to kick my mood up a couple of notches? I can hear my \"soon to be on spring break\" senior\"itis\" students asking me now...\"so the tanning bed is OK?\"  Well, I am not going that far, but I do  recommend taking a 15 minute walk outside on sunny days. Even if you are so bundled up that your face is the only thing in sight, go ahead, the face is better than nothing. In addition, ask for fish on that salad when eating out instead of chicken.  Experts disagree on the requirements for Vitamin D, and most, currently agree that the recommendations are too low. For those under 50 year of age, the requirement is 200 IU (International Units), and the requirements increase with age. However, sun exposure for 30 minutes, allows your body to make up a whopping 10,000 IU! To put it into perspective, a  3.5 oz serving of salmon contains ~360 IU and 1 cup of milk contains ~100 IU.  Since it doesn't look like I am going to get my sunny walk in soon, I think I'll just go eat some fortified D ice cream, make sure PJ ices his foot tonight, and apply some self-tanner. <\/p>",

In the past years, I have successfully avoided  the sweet girls who sell these tempting treats, but not this year.   Now, I have 11 new nieces and nephews, just waiting to hit up the latest addition to their family. How could I say no?  My favorite girl scout cookies are the<strong>Samoas.<\/strong>  <img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"\/files\/uploads\/samoa.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"101\" height=\"92\" \/> I love this caramel, toasted coconut, and chocolate striped cookie.  Deee-lish.  After doing some research for this blog,  I found out that Girl Scout cookies are made by two different bakers, which both make similar renditions of the traditional cookies. The first company, \"Little Brownie Bakers\" is actually not so little and is one of the largest cookie companies, Keebler, owned by Kellogg's.  Depending on where you live, you might call your Samoa cookie a \" <strong>Caramel deLite<\/strong> .\"  The Caramel deLite is the samoa's twin with a slight difference in its nutritional profile and is made ABC Bakers owned by Interbake Foods.  Every year, the two bakers try out at least one new type of cookie on us. If they're big sellers, you will see them again, (aka- the thin mint). Otherwise, they end up on the retirement list, like the <strong>Lemon Coolers<\/strong> (a light, lemony flavored cookie dusted with powdered sugar) or the <strong>Ole Ole<\/strong> (which was a wedding style type of cookie, light and flaky, dusted with pecans and coconut) did. This year the new addition (seen below) is the \"dulce de leche\"  <img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"\/files\/uploads\/dulcedeleche.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"135\" height=\"135\" \/>  Believe it or not, the Girl Scouts may be looking out for our health.  Introduce the Girl Scout \"lighter\" cookies! (In my opinion, it won't be a big surprise if we don't see them on the order sheet next year).  The <strong>reduced-fat \"daisy go round<\/strong> s\" come in 100 calorie \"snack packs\" and have only 2 grams of fat, 1 gram saturated fat, and 8 grams of sugar.  Compared to one serving of my \"2\" samoas, they are quite a bit lighter. The samoas contain the highest amount of fat at 8 grams and 6 whopping grams of saturated fat.  Darn my taste buds.  <img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"\/files\/uploads\/SugarFreeChocolateChip.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"131\" height=\"132\" \/>  The <strong>sugar-free chocolate chip cookies<\/strong> contain 0 grams of sugar and 7 grams sugar alcohols (sugar alcohols are only partially digested by our bodies). Although low in sugar, they are still fairly high in fat, with 9 grams of fat in 3 cookies.

In the past years, I have successfully avoided  the sweet girls who sell these tempting treats, but not this year.   Now, I have 11 new nieces and nephews, just waiting to hit up the latest addition to their family. How could I say no?  My favorite girl scout cookies are theSamoas.   I love this caramel, toasted coconut, and chocolate striped cookie.  Deee-lish.  After doing some research for this blog,  I found out that Girl Scout cookies are made by two different bakers, which both make similar renditions of the traditional cookies. The first company, \"Little Brownie Bakers\" is actually not so little and is one of the largest cookie companies, Keebler, owned by Kellogg's.  Depending on where you live, you might call your Samoa cookie a \" Caramel deLite .\"  The Caramel deLite is the samoa's twin with a slight difference in its nutritional profile and is made ABC Bakers owned by Interbake Foods.  Every year, the two bakers try out at least one new type of cookie on us. If they're big sellers, you will see them again, (aka- the thin mint). Otherwise, they end up on the retirement list, like the Lemon Coolers (a light, lemony flavored cookie dusted with powdered sugar) or the Ole Ole (which was a wedding style type of cookie, light and flaky, dusted with pecans and coconut) did. This year the new addition (seen below) is the \"dulce de leche\"    Believe it or not, the Girl Scouts may be looking out for our health.  Introduce the Girl Scout \"lighter\" cookies! (In my opinion, it won't be a big surprise if we don't see them on the order sheet next year).  The reduced-fat \"daisy go round s\" come in 100 calorie \"snack packs\" and have only 2 grams of fat, 1 gram saturated fat, and 8 grams of sugar.  Compared to one serving of my \"2\" samoas, they are quite a bit lighter. The samoas contain the highest amount of fat at 8 grams and 6 whopping grams of saturated fat.  Darn my taste buds.    The sugar-free chocolate chip cookies contain 0 grams of sugar and 7 grams sugar alcohols (sugar alcohols are only partially digested by our bodies). Although low in sugar, they are still fairly high in fat, with 9 grams of fat in 3 cookies. Not to be the cookie monster, but I am not a fan of their taste or consistency and feel they are a poor representation of the classic chocolate chip cookie.  As an additional health benefit , since 2007, the Girl Scout cookies have  contained \"0\" grams of trans fats.

I told PJ that when we trained together for our upcoming marathon our runs could be a great time to \"connect.\"  However, the knee pain I was beginning to experience with each stride was too much, and we still had 10 miles to go.  I had to resort to \"I Will Survive\" on my iPod.  Training can be so frustrating.  I had gotten all the way to my longest run, and a reoccurring past injury called \"IT band syndrome\" reminded me that it could still stop me in my tracks. As soon as I got home, I got online to research my knee pain, and as I suspected the advice was...rest.  Recovery from this type of injury could take weeks or months of no running. I wasn't giving up so easily.  The day before, I met with one of my client-athletes for a nutrition consultation, and she mentioned to me that she had tried acupuncture for her over-training issue called plantar fasciitis.  After years of this problem, she said that acupuncture was the only thing that had done the trick.  That conversation rung in my head, and it didn't take long for me to get her acupuncturist's (Christine) number. I was in Christine's office that next Monday morning, describing to her where I hurt.  I was new to acupuncture but actually wasn't too worried. Her calming office and soothing music made it seem like I was going in for a massage.  As I filled out my medical history form, I had to identify on a drawing where my pain was located.  After circling about 20 different areas on my legs and feet, I asked Christine, \"Are all your clients this hypochondriac-like?\" She assured me I was normal.  <img src=\"\/files\/uploads\/moz-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>  <img src=\"\/files\/uploads\/moz-screenshot-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> After discussing my aches and pains, she went through a description of holistic terminology I remember from my college yoga days -- words like chakras, flow and chi -- to describe how acupuncture worked.  She then felt my pulse and asked me to stick out my tongue. That one surprised me.  But I passed the test with flying colors and bragged to my husband that I have a beautiful tongue...so says my acupuncturist.  Next, she showed me the tiny needles that would be gently tapped into my body.  To be honest, the needles inserted into my legs were fairly painless. The needles placed in my feet caused a little discomfort, but nothing compared to other lovely things women put themselves through (aka: waxing).  She then left me alone for 30 minutes to allow the needles to do their work (break up that bad \"chi\" and cause white blood cells to migrate to the injury sites and speed up the healing process). I actually fell asleep. It was relaxing!  30 minutes later, the needles were removed, and Christine suggested I drink a lot of water and call her after my first run to see how things went. Regardless of this treatment, I have still been stretching, icing and taking anti-inflammatories. I haven't abandoned traditional medicine. (: However, if I run pain-free this weekend, you better believe I won't hesitate to be a voodoo doll again. <img src=\"\/files\/uploads\/moz-screenshot-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>  <\/p>",

Because the weather was rather chilly and rainy we ended up playing several card games, and ate our way through a lot of \"dips.\" Although my mom is fairly health conscious, she had purchased a crab dip (with pseudo crab) and an artichoke and cream cheese dip. Delicious they were, healthy they were not.  With the arrival of warm weather, you might be attending some upcoming BBQs or grill outs and could use a quick dish idea. I thought a run down of some of my favorite pre-made, easy dips might be of some help!  Let's start with <strong>hummus<\/strong> . Although most people have had hummus before, they might not know what it actually is. Hummus is made from a puree of chickpeas (garbanzo beans), tahini (a paste of sesame seeds), oil, and usually lemon juice and garlic. There are all sorts of variations of this dip, one of my favorites is Trader Joe's Horseradish hummus. I love its spicy kick. Hummus in general, is quite a healthy spread, as it usually contains healthy monounsaturated fat from olive oil, and fiber from the beans. The calories can add up quickly though (most have 50 calories in 2 Tbsp). I have started to make my own humus in a food processor.&nbsp; After the first try, it is quite easy, a ton cheaper, and 2 cans of chickpeas makes enough for my hummus loving husband.  Next is a dip called \" <strong>Baba Ghanoush<\/strong> .\" I just love saying that name. Baba is similar to hummus, but in lieu of the chickpeas, it subs smoky eggplant. Both spreads are tasty when added to a turkey or deli sandwich. For an afternoon snack, I will often fill a whole wheat tortilla with some of this dip for a fiber-filled treat.  We all know <strong>guacamole,<\/strong> a dip made from avocados, lime juice, and sometimes other additions like cilantro, garlic, cayenne pepper, onions, tomatoes, jalopenos, and\/or cumin powder. My guacamole recipe is never the same. Although even more calorically dense than hummus, avocados are an excellent source of healthy fats.&nbsp; You do have to be careful of the store bought products. For example, Kraft Guacaomole is mostly water, partially hydrogenated coconut and soybean oil, and corn syrup. Not really the fresh ingredients you think of when craving guacamole. Once again, Trader Joe's product scores a home-run with its taste and real ingredient list. Try guacamole on a veggie burger or on top of grilled fish.  Now comes my favorite, <strong>salsa<\/strong> . Last night, I went to a great restaurant in Maplewood, called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.riverfronttimes.com\/locations\/maya-cafand-233--4848\">Maya Cafe<\/a> . They have some the tastiest salsa around (in my opinion). It is more like a pico de gallo than salsa.&nbsp; Because salsa is made from mostly vegetables, it is a very low calorie dip, with usually 10-20 calories per 2 tablespoon serving. If concerned about the sodium content, you do have to watch some of the store bought jarred salsas which tend to have more sodium. My top store bought brands are Trader Joe's Thai Style Mango and Newman's Own Organic Chunky. Try putting salsa on a baked potato a healthy, non-calorie loaded topping.  Finally, we have the <strong>Caponatas and Tapenades<\/strong> . Caponata is made of diced eggplant, tomatoes, and onions cooked in olive oil and seasoned with capers and olives.&nbsp; A tapenade is made from green or black olives and oil.&nbsp; Due to the olives, this dip is higher in sodium. These dips go great on vegetables like green beans or also on top of a white flaky baked fish like wild cod fillets.  So spread the love, and spread on some healthy dips with friends this spring! <\/p>",

                        "content" => "<p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"> Over Memorial Day weekend, PJ and I did a ton of grilling. Our grill is only 1 year old this summer, so we are still trying to figure him out. Grilling is one of my favorite cooking methods and is a great method for cooking low-fat, flavorful foods. We have \"tried\" to grill everything from the non-traditional foods like figs and flatbreads to staples like hamburgers and chicken. <\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"> Unfortunately, the charred taste some of us love (or inadvertently create), might be putting us at risk. Recent attention has focused on the link between grilling and cancer, in particular, stomach, colorectal, lung, and breast cancer. The culprits are cancer causing agents called heterocyclic amines (HCA) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). These chemical substances are formed when fat is heated to high temperatures. <\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"> So now what? Cut back on grilling? Absolutely not. There are several tips you can follow to relieve your grilling woes, and it can all start with a tasty marinade. A recent study from Kansas  State University marinated the same cut of meat in 3 different marinades. The various marinades reduced these \"bad\" chemicals anywhere from 57-88%. The largest reduction (88%) was seen in the &ldquo;Caribbean Marinade&rdquo; . <\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Here are some additional steps for a healthy grill out.<\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in\"> &eth;    Avoid placing meats in contact with high flames or extreme heat through grilling, broiling, barbecuing, or frying. <\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5in\"> &eth;    Grill foods such as vegetables, veggie burgers, quesadillas, or even pizza.

Grilling is one of my favorite cooking methods and is a great method for cooking low-fat, flavorful foods. We have \"tried\" to grill everything from the non-traditional foods like figs and flatbreads to staples like hamburgers and chicken.   Unfortunately, the charred taste some of us love (or inadvertently create), might be putting us at risk. Recent attention has focused on the link between grilling and cancer, in particular, stomach, colorectal, lung, and breast cancer. The culprits are cancer causing agents called heterocyclic amines (HCA) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). These chemical substances are formed when fat is heated to high temperatures.   So now what? Cut back on grilling? Absolutely not. There are several tips you can follow to relieve your grilling woes, and it can all start with a tasty marinade. A recent study from Kansas  State University marinated the same cut of meat in 3 different marinades. The various marinades reduced these \"bad\" chemicals anywhere from 57-88%. The largest reduction (88%) was seen in the &ldquo;Caribbean Marinade&rdquo; .  Here are some additional steps for a healthy grill out.  &eth;    Avoid placing meats in contact with high flames or extreme heat through grilling, broiling, barbecuing, or frying.   &eth;    Grill foods such as vegetables, veggie burgers, quesadillas, or even pizza. These foods contain little fat and can be a fun new way to introduce to the grill.   &eth;    Choose lean and trimmed meats. They have less fat to drip into flames and cause flare-ups.   &eth;    Briefly cook meats and poultry in the microwave before placing on the grill, this will remove some of the drippings that could cause flare-ups.   &eth;    Place meat on aluminum foil instead of directly on the grill to avoid juices into the fire or flames touching the meat. Not only does this help prevent charring, but it also makes for easy clean-up.   &eth;    Keep your grill clean.   &eth;    Keep a spray bottle on hand to tame flames.   &eth;    Remove charred portions of meat before eating.   Happy Grilling!",

At this stage in my life, many of my friends are or are trying to have children, and avoid our past frequented watering holes.  I guess it works out for everyone, I get to introduce them to my new favorite eatery in the loop, fro yo, my new go-to dessert spot. Fortunately or unfortunately, it is close to my home.  Fro Yo opened its doors about 6 months ago. I vividly remember the day I noticed the \"frozen yogurt, coming soon\" sign in the door.  Everyday for 2 months, I drove by to see if they had opened yet.  In Tennessee, where I am from, the well-known frozen yogurt store was The Country's Best Yogurt (TCBY) and the \"shiver\" was my common (and frequently often) order. When I moved to St. Louis, I searched and searched for my beloved TCBY and finally found it in the East Terminal airport at Lambert. Not the most ideal spot for a quick sweet tooth fix.  I soon realized that custard was the queen of frozen dessert in St. Louis.  Delicious, no doubt.  But if I ate custard as much as I ate TCBY, my parents would not have recognized me when I returned home.  Enter the answer: fro yo. Fro Yo trumps TCBY for several reasons. First of all, it is self-serve, and I can tailor my portion to my hunger, mood, etc.  Second, there are at least 8 different yogurt flavors to choose. Can't make up your mind? Try them all!  You can select from yogurts which truly are \"yogurt-like\" and tart (which I never choose) or fill your fro-yo cup with creamy, sweet flavors, like my favorite: white chococolate macademia nut.  Now, the part that really \"tops\" TCBY.  Fruits, candies, nuts, cheesecake, brownies, whipped cream, the list goes on.  The toppings are also self serve and you can select from common fruits like kiwi, strawberries and bananas or go for the more exotic fruit like the \"lychee\" berry.  Once again, I go straight for the chocolate and bypass anything I could put on my morning cereal.  Time to check out your damage.  There are two sizes of fro-yo cups, and my dietitian eye would guess the small cup holds 4 cups of delicious-ness.  Similar to stepping on the scale at home, you must weigh your creation and pay the price.  So far, the cashier hasn't gasped at my ice cream weight, so I must be somewhere within the patron norm.  The calories in fro yo yogurt are ~110 calories per half cup. Unfortunately, there are no standards in labeling for yogurt like there are for ice cream which are the requirements mandated by the Food and Drug Administration for ice cream.  But as a comparison, here are some ice cream nutrition facts.  Real ice cream must contain 10% butter fat (7 grams of fat) per 1\/2 cup.  Some \"premium\" ice cream contain 16%.  Ice cream must state on the label whether it was naturally or artifically flavored.  \"Reduced-fat\" ice cream means it contains 25% less fat than the original product.  \"Low-fat\" ice cream must have 3 grams of fat or less per 1\/2 cup.  \"Light\" ice cream must contain 50% less fat than the orginial product.  \"Fat-free\" ice cream must contain less than 0.5 grams per 1\/2 cup.  I also did a little research on ice cream that might give you an ice cream headache...  Dairy Queen's Banana Cream Pie Blizzard (large) = 1,100 calories  Baskin Robbin's Premium Oreo Sundae = 1,330 calories  Cold Stone Creamery Milk &amp; Cookie Shake = 1,660 calories  Yikes.

The lack of beef in my life has a little to do with nutrition, but more to do with the fact that I grew up on a small farm in TN with sweet little cows in my backyard. Although these cows were all black and hard to distinguish one from another, I named each and every cow, and could pick out Jerry from Oreo pretty quickly.  Last weekend, PJ brought home some grass-fed beef from a local farm. With our increased interest in buying locally, we were both pretty excited to try it, although...I must say I had a hard time getting Oreo out of my head.  Grass-fed beef is different from the more popular grain (corn) fed cows in several ways. Although, one can delve pretty deep into each issue, research continues to mount that grass-fed cattle is leaner, healthier, and more planet and cow friendly. It is more expensive, more difficult to find, and one cannot expect a consistent beef flavor due to the fact that the cows are grazing on different variations of pasture grasses. Because grass-fed cows don't suffer the consequences of diseases from confined corn-based feedlots, grass-fed cows usually do not require antibiotics as well.  Grass-fed cows have healthier amounts of good fats, like omega-3 fatty acids and Conjugated linoleic Acids's which have been linked to lower risk of certain cancers. In addition, this beef is higher in some vitamins and minerals like beta-carotene.  The grass fed beef does have a different flavor, and because the meat is leaner, it requires cooking the meat over lower temperatures, for a longer amount of time. I turned our grass-fed beef into taco meat with this recipe from Epicurious.com.&nbsp; I must say, it was delicious. <h1>Soft Beef Tacos with Salsa<\/h1> <p class=\"source\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipesmenus\/bonappetit\/recipes\">Bon App&eacute;tit<\/a> | November 1997 <\/p>  <div> <div> <p class=\"summary_data\"> <strong>Yield: Makes 4 servings<\/strong>  <\/div> <\/div> <div> <h2>Ingredients<\/h2> <ul> <li>1 tablespoon olive oil<\/li> <li>1 1\/2 pounds boneless beef chuck, cut into 3\/4-inch cubes<\/li> <li>1 cup bottled chunky medium-hot salsa<\/li> <li>1\/4 cup canned beef broth<\/li> <li>2 tablespoons chopped garlic<\/li> <li>2 tablespoons (packed) dark brown sugar<\/li> <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce<\/li> <\/ul> <ul> <li>1\/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro<\/li> <li>1 tablespoon fresh lime juice<\/li> <\/ul> <ul> <li>12 6-inch-diameter corn or flour tortillas<\/li> <\/ul> <\/div> Instructions:  Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.

There are those who mechanically toss the same grocery list of foods into their carts without giving other similar food products a chance, and then you have those who scour over their food selections comparing nutrition facts, price per ounce, etc to find the perfect food for their recipes.  No matter what your shopping style is (probably somewhere in the middle), I think we all could agree that grocery shopping can be overwhelming at times. To begin, there are so many choices, most groceries contain over 50,000 products and these numerous choices may only differ by one gram of fat or one ingredient, ie: (my most difficult dilemma) the salad dressing aisle.  In addition, food label marketing can be deceiving. While you can trust claims such as \"low-fat\" because they are standardized and must have no more than 3 grams of fat per serving, other claims such as \"natural\" or \"lightly sweetened\" tell us basically nothing.

Currently, there are about 5 different Nutritional profiling programs (potential problem #1) that utilize symbols which are placed directly on the food product or on the actual grocery shelf or both to be a visual sign to clue us in that the food your are purchasing meets some sort of \"nutritional quality\".  Each of the 5 nutrition profiling programs have different criteria for how foods qualify or don't (potential problem #2).  In order for a food to qualify for the \"Smart Choice\" Nutrient Profiling label (developed by a combination of food manufacturers, retailers, and the nutrition organizations) the food must contain more than 10% of the Daily Value of at least one nutrient (calcium, potassium, fiber, vitamins A, C, or E). The food must also be low in total, saturated, and trans fats, sodium, and sugars. Interesting enough, Frosted Flakes Cereal gets a smart choice label, while pre-portioned boneless chicken breasts would not (potential problem #3).  If you are interested in other nutrient profiling programs and their criteria, check out \"Guiding Stars\", \"Healthy Ideas\", \"Nutrition IQ\", and \"NuVal\". Depending upon your location, and whether your grocery store decides to support programs\/labels, you might have already seen these nutrition symbols.  The debate will continue on whether nutrient profiling programs help or hurt in terms of our food decisions, but there is no debate that non-processed, whole foods like fruits, veggies, and whole grains, symbol or no symbol will always get a healthy food rating.  <img src=\"\/files\/uploads\/moz-screenshot-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>  <\/p>",

Food Outreach provides nutrition services for people living with HIV\/AIDS and cancer.  The purpose of the 7-day hunger challenge is to raise awareness for those in our community and country who face critical nutrition issues when living on a fixed income.  As part of the challenge, we are encouraged to limit our food purchases to $29 dollars per week. This is the amount I would be allotted if I was participating in the food stamp program.  $29\/7 = $4.14 per day.  With the changes in our economy over the year, as a Dietitian, I have had several requests by reporters or writers for budget-friendly meal ideas for their segments like \"How to feed a family of 4 for $20 per day.\"  These requests required me to price out ONE meals' ingredients, but that was the extent of my efforts.  As I begin to think about applying this to ME, and what I will eat for the week of Sept 1-Sept 7, the task begins to seem much more challenging, and to be honest, I think, why didn't I assign this to the students in one of my nutrition classes?  When grocery shopping, I pay attention to the price per ounce when comparing items, and I frequently purchase sale items and store brand items. Our household money is spent on nutritious inexpensive foods like beans, frozen vegetables, rice, etc. I bring my lunch to work, I eat at home most nights of the week. But, I also \"splurge.\" I do spring for certain foods like the nicer cuts of fish, or the higher fiber grain products, and I purchase these items not only because I like the way they taste, but could spending extra money now potentially save me money later on smaller health care bills?  Others however, do not have such the luxury, yet they deserve the ability to eat healthy just like I do.  So as a dietitian, I feel it is my responsibility to help others see that they can feed their family nutritious foods that can be purchased in an affordable way. The Hunger Challenge presents me with some practice to do so.  Yet, I begin to think about those favorite foods I take for granted.  Coffee, even though I brew my own coffee at home, when I think about the creamer, splenda, and sometimes a dollap of whipped cream...it almost takes too much effort just to calculate the costs! Either way, I think I can get by without it for a week, and save those precious pennies for something else.  Diet coke, another caffeine source bites the dust. I will miss the afternoon jolt, but once again, I could use the pennies for food.  Eating out. I can't even imagine how that could possibly fit. That makes me sad. I am going to find some great happy hour deals somewhere.  I am still in the planning phase, but here are some of things I know I can change:  Breakfast: I have to eat the same quantity, you don't want a hangry (hungry + angry) teacher for my early morning students, I will just switch to store brand cereal and store brand English muffins. For a snack, I plan on buying bagged on-sale apples instead of my favorite pink lady apples, which are never on sale.  Sometimes for dinner I make omelets, eggs are a cheap source of protein, but instead of the omega-3 fatty acid fed eggs, I will buy the store brand.  I eat a vegetables with both lunch and dinner, therefore I will have to figure out which veggies give me the best bang for my buck, and I will more than likely visit the farmer's market. The pressure cooker will be busted out of the cabinet and be put to good use making a bean soup.  But what about my microwave Kettle Corn? I hope I can make it fit, but if not, the air popper will finally get used as well.  No doubt, this is not going to be easy. It will take planning, and possibly more time in the kitchen. My goal is to stick to the budget as close as possible, and also maybe come up with some recipes that I can continue to use in the future.  I have to remind myself, it is only for a week, and how blessed am I that this is just an \"experiment?\" <\/p>",

Like the other Food Outreach bloggers, I went to the store armed and ready with a well planned grocery list for the week(note, week, not weekend yet...too daunting).  As I shopped, I found myself being very grateful for the \"price per ounce\" assistance on the grocery shelves. I used this reference for almost every item comparison. I had no idea that a food like vegetable broth (which will go in my parsnip soup recipe) had such a wide range of prices when compared by the ounce. The soup recipe called for 64 ounces, so the highest broth price at 14 cents per ounce compared to the cheapest broth at 4 cents per ounce really made a difference .  Another shocker, or shall I say disappointment, was how small the apples are that came in the #3 pound bag. With 13 apples in the bag, each apple set me back 23 cents. I did feel better knowing the apples were grown in Missouri, but when eaten as a snack, the small portion left me wishing for more.  Once I got home from the store, I decided that preparing my dinner meals for the week would ensure I stuck to the meal plan. The first recipe (which I will share later) was a parsnip and carrot soup and the second meal was a lentil, pasta, and rice dish with a mint butter sauce. Both recipes turned out pretty tasty, and I was happy to be able to include my \"mint on steroids\" plant from backyard garden. Free herbs are coming in handy.  As I mentioned in my previous blog, I am addicted to the 94% fat free Act II kettle corn. I am not for sure if it's the popcorn that I love or the relaxation of eating the popcorn while I watch \"Chopped\" on the Food Network. Either way, the microwave popcorn was too expensive so I grudgingly purchased the plain popcorn kernels. After two hours in the kitchen preparing my weekly dinners, I found myself hungry and decided to introduce the kernels to my air popper. For 5 cents, I popped ~6 cups of popcorn and after adding a touch of salt and sugar was pleasantly surprised with the tasty and nutritious, and most importantly -inexpensive, source of pleasure.  I do have a confession already for Day 1. After today's lunch, I received the gift of a diet coke. I didn't allocate any money to my afternoon soda habit, so I am very gracious to my caffeine angel. <\/p>",

No, it is a list of foods that the health action organization, Center for Science in the Public interest released as their list of the top 10 riskiest foods for Americans to eat. Here they are listed in order from the highest risk to the least risk:  1) Leafy greens  2) Eggs  3) Tuna fish  4) Oysters  5) Potatoes  6) Cheese  7) Ice cream  8) Tomatoes  9) Sprouts  10) Berries  (Today's Menu: Breakfast: Cereal topped with <strong>berries<\/strong> ; Mid-morning snack: <strong>hard-boiled egg;<\/strong> Lunch: <strong><\/strong> <strong>tunafish<\/strong> sandwich topped with <strong>lettuce &amp; tomato<\/strong> , Afternoon snack: <strong>string cheese<\/strong> , Anticipated dessert: <strong>ice cream.  Done, I just ate<\/strong> 7\/10 ten risky foods... <strong><\/strong> So how did these seemingly healthy foods make the top 10 riskiest list? Basically, these foods along with seven other foods make up 40% of all of the foodborne related illnesses and outbreaks dating back to 1990.  According the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) these 10 foods caused ~1,500 outbreaks and over 50,000 illnesses.  CSPI didn't release this information with the intent to stop us from eating these foods, but more so to send strong message to the Food and Drug Administration to tighten up ship.  CSPI feels that the food safety \"police\" should set and enforce more stringent food safety regulations so Americans can trust their food system.  As you can see by my menu today, I haven't eliminated these foods from my diet. However, this release did remind me to continue to do what \"I\" can do to best protect myself and my family from foodborne illness. <strong>\"Lettuce\" start with greens<\/strong> . Although convenient, many of the leafy green outbreaks were associated with eating bagged, pre-washed greens. Bagged greens compared to the simple head of lettuce are more processed, handled and come into contact with a larger amount of leafy greens. Because of this, bagged lettuce might have a higher risk of contamination.  Greens as a whole, grow close to the ground, and therefore are more susceptible to pathogens due to contaminated irrigation water, manure, and unsafe handling practices. <em>Take home message:<\/em> remove the outer leaves, rinse greens several times, and rinse greens even if it says it has been pre-washed. <strong>Eggs:<\/strong> Most people are aware that eggs can be contaminated with salmonella both on the outside and <em>inside<\/em> of the egg.  Cooking your egg throughly is the best way to protect yourself. <strong>Tuna Fish:<\/strong> The \"type\" of tuna largely associated with outbreaks was fresh or raw tuna, not the canned tuna I have in my sandwich today.

Therefore, your fate is left in the hands of those who handle your food, so weigh the pros and cons. Fortunately, this is an easy decision for me, I love the cracker with horseradish and hot sauce, but I do without the oyster. <strong>Potatoes:<\/strong> Luckily the beloved potato, is incriminated because of the ingredients it associates itself with: mayo and sour cream. The tuber is also more susceptible because it is in close contact with the soil and therefore is at higher risk for the same reason lettuce is. <em>Take home?<\/em> Don't leave your \"salads\" out longer than two hours in the danger zone (40-140 degrees), and scrub the outside of your potato well. <strong>Cheese:<\/strong> Making cheese requires several steps (curdling, salting, processing) therefore, there are more opportunities for contamination.

Washing tomatoes well and using separate cutting boards for produce and raw meat will help to minimize risk. <strong>Sprouts<\/strong> : Some say we should completely avoid eating sprouts like alfalfa or mung bean sprouts because the \"seed\" houses the contaminant, and therefore no amount of rinsing can remove the problem.&nbsp; Sprouts require a warm and moist environment to grow, and unfortunately, that is the same type of environment that pathogens like to grow in as well.  So unless you really love your sprouts, leaving them off your next sandwich might be a good idea. <strong>Berries:<\/strong> Fortunately, the largest outbreak with berries (strawberries) occurred way back in 1997, but berries like blackberries and raspberries have always carried a food borne illness risk.  A thorough wash can help, but is not a guarantee that it can remove the risk.  In summary, I hope this report doesn't scare people away from eating foods like potatoes and berries, but serves as a reminder to handle our food safely, and most importantly speaks to those who set the policies and procedures so we can ensure that healthy food we eat, truly is healthy. <\/p>",

No, it is a list of foods that the health action organization, Center for Science in the Public interest released as their list of the top 10 riskiest foods for Americans to eat. Here they are listed in order from the highest risk to the least risk:  1) Leafy greens  2) Eggs  3) Tuna fish  4) Oysters  5) Potatoes  6) Cheese  7) Ice cream  8) Tomatoes  9) Sprouts  10) Berries  (Today's Menu: Breakfast: Cereal topped with berries ; Mid-morning snack: hard-boiled egg; Lunch:  tunafish sandwich topped with lettuce &amp; tomato , Afternoon snack: string cheese , Anticipated dessert: ice cream.  Done, I just ate 7\/10 ten risky foods...  So how did these seemingly healthy foods make the top 10 riskiest list? Basically, these foods along with seven other foods make up 40% of all of the foodborne related illnesses and outbreaks dating back to 1990.  According the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) these 10 foods caused ~1,500 outbreaks and over 50,000 illnesses.  CSPI didn't release this information with the intent to stop us from eating these foods, but more so to send strong message to the Food and Drug Administration to tighten up ship.  CSPI feels that the food safety \"police\" should set and enforce more stringent food safety regulations so Americans can trust their food system.  As you can see by my menu today, I haven't eliminated these foods from my diet. However, this release did remind me to continue to do what \"I\" can do to best protect myself and my family from foodborne illness. \"Lettuce\" start with greens . Although convenient, many of the leafy green outbreaks were associated with eating bagged, pre-washed greens. Bagged greens compared to the simple head of lettuce are more processed, handled and come into contact with a larger amount of leafy greens. Because of this, bagged lettuce might have a higher risk of contamination.  Greens as a whole, grow close to the ground, and therefore are more susceptible to pathogens due to contaminated irrigation water, manure, and unsafe handling practices. Take home message: remove the outer leaves, rinse greens several times, and rinse greens even if it says it has been pre-washed. Eggs: Most people are aware that eggs can be contaminated with salmonella both on the outside and inside of the egg.  Cooking your egg throughly is the best way to protect yourself. Tuna Fish: The \"type\" of tuna largely associated with outbreaks was fresh or raw tuna, not the canned tuna I have in my sandwich today.

Potatoes: Luckily the beloved potato, is incriminated because of the ingredients it associates itself with: mayo and sour cream. The tuber is also more susceptible because it is in close contact with the soil and therefore is at higher risk for the same reason lettuce is. Take home? Don't leave your \"salads\" out longer than two hours in the danger zone (40-140 degrees), and scrub the outside of your potato well. Cheese: Making cheese requires several steps (curdling, salting, processing) therefore, there are more opportunities for contamination.  In addition, softer cheeses like brie or camembert, tend to carry higher risk of listeria and should be avoided by pregnant women. Ice Cream: The outbreaks with ice cream tend to be related to using contaminated eggs and unsafe food handling practices by your local ice cream scooper.

I going to a holiday \"girls dinner,\" lunch at PI for my \"Hot Topics\" class, a holiday work party on Friday night, and the list goes on.  I am looking forward to them all, but I must admit, these food-centered events will lead to a calorie heavy week.  Part of the holiday fun includes enjoying seasonal foods.  As a dietitian who likes to promote rather than demote foods, I urge my nutrition clients to savor in these food festivities.  I emphasize the word \"savor\" and remind them about the power of being mindful.  I recently read an eye-opening book about the environment's influence on our food choices. The book, \"Mindless Eating,\" by food psychologist, Brian Wainsink shares his research on the role of environment on eating behaviors.  Even for a dietitian who is already supposed to \"know\" all of this stuff, his findings provided me some real insight for drafting a healthy holiday eating game plan for both myself and my clients.  Here are some of the take home messages I received from reading Dr. Wainsink's book.  Check it out for many more pearls of eating wisdom.  1) Take the smallest plate  In Dr. Wainsink's  research, he studied the eating habits of overweight individuals versus healthy weight individuals at a holiday buffet. The healthy weight participants were 7 times more likely to choose the smaller plates over the larger plates.  For many of us, (esp those who have gotten new serving ware over the past couple of years), the salad plate can easily serve as our dinner plate.  And the glasses!  The wine glasses we got for our wedding last year hold a whopping 15 oz of wine.  Without even knowing it, we serve AND eat almost 50% more when we use bigger plates, glasses, etc.   So, use the smaller dishes, and then, if you are still hungry after serving your holiday food, allow yourself to go back for more. <p class=\"MsoListParagraph\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 1in\"> <!--[if !supportLists]--> <\/p> 2) Eat Slowly, and Just Eat  Those who are overweight also ate 3 times faster. I realize that every once in awhile we must read, work, or stand up while eating. But are there times where we could slow down, taste our food, and give food our undivided attention? If so, the research proves, you are much more likely to feel satisfied after you are finished, and potentially eat less.  3) Distract and remove  I linger around food tables at parties.  Is it a comfort thing? Is it an easy way to stuff something in my mouth in case I say something I didn't want to say? :) Or do I just love holiday food as much as the next person? Either way, Dr. Wainsink's research also tells that the closer we position ourselves to the food, the more we eat.  So those two extra hot wings? Whether I wanted them or not, I consumed 100 extra calories that I had no \"mental\" note of eating. The overweight individuals in his study sat 16 feet closer to the buffet table.  4) Do the fly-by  71% of those healthy weight individuals perused the food offerings before serving themselves versus only 33% of the overweight individuals.  Getting an idea of how you want to spend your caloric budget can really make a difference on how much food and what foods will fill your plate. I tend to avoid those \"common\" foods that I can eat on any typically day. Take for instance, mashed potatoes, <em>boring<\/em> (to me), so why waste the bites? I would much rather have my mom's sugary sweet potatoes.  Either way, I have made a mental game plan of my plates fate.  5) See What You Eat:  This was an interesting one. Dr. Wainsink makes the argument that if you could SEE everything you ate while you ate it, that you would eat much less. To prove this point, he provided graduate students free hot wings at a happy hour. He asked the waitstaff to remove only half of the students' plates of empty bones. Those students who were left staring at the pile of bones ate 20-30% less than those students whose plates were removed.  In general, most foods after consumed don't leave a pile of reminders on your plate, but the take away strategy for holiday eating is to fill your plate with EVERYTHING you intend to eat.  Instead of thinking you will take several plates of small amounts, get it all done at once. Mentally, you will see a larger amount of food, feel full faster, and this will allow you to focus on the friends and family: the real purpose of the party.  Tis the season for holiday eating! If this season you find yourself enjoying the tasty treats while being more mindful and balanced, you will be able to reflect back on a happy and healthy holiday time, and feel ready to face Jan 1st 2010. <\/p>",

Mentally, you will see a larger amount of food, feel full faster, and this will allow you to focus on the friends and family: the real purpose of the party.  Tis the season for holiday eating! If this season you find yourself enjoying the tasty treats while being more mindful and balanced, you will be able to reflect back on a happy and healthy holiday time, and feel ready to face Jan 1st 2010.",

I am unsure of my own track record, but I would bet it is similar. Here are some of my resolutions that I seem to re-visit every year:  1)Be more organized and clean (hum...I believe I apologized to PJ as I ran out the door this morning for leaving such a mess)  2) Go to church more regularly and be more active in my church community (already missed the first weekend of mass)  3) Lift weights at least 3 times a week (so far I have batted 2\/3, but dang it is hard to get out of bed at 5:10am with record lows and facing the chore of de-icing your car in the dark).  One resolution that I have been practicing more often and is a technique I plan to use in my nutrition couseling sessions with clients, is to be aware of the words which leave my mouth. I am reading a very interesting book called, \"Every Word Has Power\" by Yvonne Oswald. The premise of this book revolves around the power of our words. She argues we should give our words more credit that we do, and that words can shape our attitude, feelings, how we perceive ourselves and therefore how others perceive us.&nbsp; Yes, this might be a little touchy-feel \"ey\", but if we really listen to how we speak, especially how  we speak about ourselves, we might notice that a lot of it isn't positive.&nbsp; Those less positive words are called \"low-energy\" words and positive words are considered \"high-energy\" words.  Let me give you some examples:  Example 1: You do something nice for someone, they thank you, and you say \"no problem.\" The last word they and you hear is a low-energy word: \"problem.\"&nbsp; Instead, the book suggests you switch your words and use a high-energy word and say \"you are very welcome.\" You are saying the same thing, just differently!  Example 2: \"Gosh, I am dreading this upcoming semester, I am teaching a brand new graduate level sports nutrition class, and I feel so unprepared!\" (true statement...)

One of my favorite quotes from this author is \"Every word you speak is a gift to someone else.\" I plan on giving a lot of more gifts with my words in 2010 than I did last year. <img src=\"\/files\/uploads\/moz-screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" \/>  <\/p>",

Unlike the hidden sugars we are seeing pop up in our everyday non-sweet foods.&nbsp; One hundred years ago, Americans consumed approximately 4 teaspoons of sugar a day. Today, we drown ourselves in over 30 teaspoons.  What can we blame this increase on? Soda? Cookies? Candy? Maybe, maybe those foods contribute to this problem. But why does spaghetti sauce need so much sugar? How can a \"Healthy\" Choice frozen dinner contain over 4 teaspoons of sugar? Why should a cereal advertising its heart healthy oats be dripping with 5 teaspoons of sugar AND have more sugar than Froot Loops?  We are being fooled. We are tricked to think that these foods are \"healthy\" when in reality they are not. Yet  food manufacturers continue to pull the wool over our eyes adding more and more sugar to foods that are not even supposed to be sweet.  So how can you beat this system? How can you be a sugar busting slueth?  Here are a couple of tips:  First of all, it would be helpful to have some sort of reference. The American Heart Association recently made a recommendation that females should aim for 6 teaspoons or less of added sugars a day and that males should shoot for 9 teaspoons or less of added sugar.&nbsp; Now, can see how the above food choices would ruin your daily allotment quickly?  Next you need to scan the ingredient list on the food packaging and familiarize yourself with sugar and all its aliases. Sugar comes in many shapes, forms, and names. If you see words that end in \"ose\" like dextrose, maltose, sucrose = those are sugars. Any words that has \"syrup\" in it...is sugar = malt syrup, rice syrup, etc. And of course the familiar sugars like honey and molasses also deliver sugar calories.  If any of those sugar terms show up in the first 3 ingredients OR are listed numerous times within the ingredient list...find another product that has less. For example, not all spaghetti sauce contains 2 teaspoons of sugar, there are plenty out there that only contain 1 teaspoon. You just have to compare.  Tip 3: Do not trust claims on the front of the food container. Frosted flakes claims \"reduced sugar.\" The truth is yes, they \"reduced\" sugars from 11 to 8 grams per serving, however, the overall calories and total carbohydrates are the same. In lieu of sugar, they added more refined flour.  Tip 4: When you see \"made with real fruit,\" be skeptical.&nbsp; The first ingredient on a box of chewy fruit snacks marketed to kids with this claim was corn syrup.  Tip 5: Continue eating the true \"natural\" sugars, found in fruits, vegetables, and dairy. These sugars are nicely packaged with vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, fiber, and water.  One hundred years ago, back when Grandpa would have been in his teens, people were farming, fishing, and just plain active. Maybe they could tolerated the 30 tsp sugar we consume today without the negative consequences. However, they didn't...they consumed 6x less.&nbsp; Grandpa also didn't have didn't have to worry about hidden sugars. They consumed food like corn in its natural state, right off the cobb, not in in high fructose corn syrup.  \"Gimme some sugar\" but I'll take it Grandpa style, a kiss on the cheek with love. <\/p>",

Our CSA is run by a non-profit organization called Fair Shares ( <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fairshares.org\">www.fairshares.org<\/a> ) which establishes and maintains relationships with food producers from Missouri and Illinois.&nbsp; Food producers of meat, produce, dairy, bread, pasta, mushrooms, nuts, coffee, grains and flour all participate.

Last week, I picked up my first bag from our CSA ( <a title=\"Fair Shares \" href=\"http:\/\/www.fairshares.org\">www.fairshares.org<\/a> ) which was filled with two different types of lettuce, spinach, mint, eggs, goat cheese (this didn't last long), homemade peanut butter, grass-fed flank steak, blackberry jelly, black bean soup, and a variety of wild mushrooms.&nbsp; Many CSA's will focus on offering only produce, but we are lucky that our CSA offers many other grocery staples as well.  To make the most of this experience, I have set some personal goals. <strong>Goal #1<\/strong> : Minimize waste and try to use EVERYTHING. To accomplish this goal, the produce needs to be prepped and ready to eat, recipe ideas need to be thought of ahead of time, and projections of how much we can feasibly eat are made and then the rest is frozen. One of our items last week was mint, and I turned it into a mint pesto that we have been enjoying on crackers. See recipe below. <div style=\"border: medium none;color: #000000;text-align: left;text-decoration: none\"> <strong>Mint  pesto<\/strong> <ul class=\"ingredientsList\"> <li class=\"ingredient\">1\/2 cup pine nuts, toasted<\/li> <li class=\"ingredient\">3 garlic cloves, peeled<\/li> <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tablespoons (packed) feta cheese<\/li> <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tablespoons (packed) Parmesan cheese<\/li> <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tablespoon coarsely chopped jalape&ntilde;o chile<\/li> <li class=\"ingredient\">1\/2 teaspoon salt<\/li> <li class=\"ingredient\">1\/2 teaspoon ground black pepper<\/li> <li class=\"ingredient\">2 cups (packed) fresh mint leaves<\/li> <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<\/li> <li class=\"ingredient\">1\/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil<\/li> <\/ul> For mint pesto: Combine first 7 ingredients in a food processor.

As I box up textbooks, staplers, and pictures off my wall, I have run across a couple of items which have reminded me of many amazing individuals that have touched my life here at SLU.  1) <strong>An oversized eating spoon<\/strong> : Several years ago, a faculty member from the Occupational Therapy department noticed a disheartened look on my face as we passed in the hallway. After asking if I was ok, I shared with her that I had just returned from a weekend in Kentucky visiting my Aunt Mary who had Parkinson's Disease. Aunt Mary had lost over 20 pounds and was looking more frail than ever. Due to the tremors caused by her disease, feeding herself had become almost impossible.&nbsp; My Aunt Mary was a determined lady, and fought hard to continue taking care of herself as much as she could.&nbsp; As an occupational therapist, this professor well understood Aunt Mary's challenge and stopped what she was doing to equip me with the appropriate tools that would make eating easier for Aunt Mary. I left her office not only feeling hopeful, but so grateful for her expertise and genuine concern.  2) <strong>An old bicycle seat<\/strong> : I have been riding my bike (May) to work for almost 4 years now and I owe this great exercise, environmentally-friendly choice, and enjoyment to a colleague here in our nutrition department.&nbsp; Although he (and his wife) are inspiring people for so many reasons, his dedication to being&nbsp; physically active and challenging himself is so impressive. The best part about his dedication is his desire to inspire others to find their inner \"athlete.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether he is emailing you information about the latest bike ride or helping someone change a bike tire, he is so supportive and encouraging and makes being active just \"easier.\"&nbsp; Even when the weather channel predicts a 50% chance of rain (or snow), I would always think to myself, would he ride in? It's always almost a yes, and I am always glad I did too.  3) <strong>The Biliken<\/strong> : A bobblehead version of SLU's mascot, the Billiken, bobbles next to me on my desk.&nbsp; In my opinion, the Billiken is both a cute and a slightly scary looking creature.&nbsp; I was given this Billiken by the SLU blogging team, and it reminds me to do something that \"scares\" me or pushes me out of my comfort zone everyday. When I was first asked to blog, I was admittedly nervous, I knew little about blogging and had a hard time believing people would want to read my thoughts. Now, I truly value the time I have to write and reflect through this blog. I credit both the Billiken and all of the other SLU individuals who have reminded me to take chances, follow my heart, and say yes to \"scary\" opportunities.  4) <strong>Candy wrappers<\/strong> : I first met this amazing lady when I was in grad school here at SLU.&nbsp; Just like all good administrative secretaries, she had a bowl of sweets on her desk for anyone to enjoy. The real sweetness about going into her office were our conversations.&nbsp; I have been eating candy from her jar for over 9 years, and I now consider her my St. Louis mom.&nbsp; I cannot say enough about her, but her selflessness, devotion as a friend, and her faith are inspiring.&nbsp; She is sweeter than any candy in that jar.  5) <strong>Letters from students:<\/strong> There were more days than I can count when I walked out of a classroom not happy with the way the class had gone. Blaming myself, I would question: Maybe I should have prepared more? Maybe I should have been more challenging? (the list goes on....). I would assume I am not alone and that all good teachers go through this self-evaluation.&nbsp; However, I am saving several heartfelt letters from students who have no idea how much I valued their expressions. A teacher will never know how many hearts and minds they have touched, but I am thankful for those students who let me know that I had.  We all pack our bags at one time or another. Enjoy the process. <\/p>",

Due to the tremors caused by her disease, feeding herself had become almost impossible.&nbsp; My Aunt Mary was a determined lady, and fought hard to continue taking care of herself as much as she could.&nbsp; As an occupational therapist, this professor well understood Aunt Mary's challenge and stopped what she was doing to equip me with the appropriate tools that would make eating easier for Aunt Mary. I left her office not only feeling hopeful, but so grateful for her expertise and genuine concern.  2) An old bicycle seat : I have been riding my bike (May) to work for almost 4 years now and I owe this great exercise, environmentally-friendly choice, and enjoyment to a colleague here in our nutrition department.&nbsp; Although he (and his wife) are inspiring people for so many reasons, his dedication to being&nbsp; physically active and challenging himself is so impressive. The best part about his dedication is his desire to inspire others to find their inner \"athlete.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether he is emailing you information about the latest bike ride or helping someone change a bike tire, he is so supportive and encouraging and makes being active just \"easier.\"&nbsp; Even when the weather channel predicts a 50% chance of rain (or snow), I would always think to myself, would he ride in? It's always almost a yes, and I am always glad I did too.  3) The Biliken : A bobblehead version of SLU's mascot, the Billiken, bobbles next to me on my desk.&nbsp; In my opinion, the Billiken is both a cute and a slightly scary looking creature.&nbsp; I was given this Billiken by the SLU blogging team, and it reminds me to do something that \"scares\" me or pushes me out of my comfort zone everyday. When I was first asked to blog, I was admittedly nervous, I knew little about blogging and had a hard time believing people would want to read my thoughts. Now, I truly value the time I have to write and reflect through this blog. I credit both the Billiken and all of the other SLU individuals who have reminded me to take chances, follow my heart, and say yes to \"scary\" opportunities.  4) Candy wrappers : I first met this amazing lady when I was in grad school here at SLU.&nbsp; Just like all good administrative secretaries, she had a bowl of sweets on her desk for anyone to enjoy. The real sweetness about going into her office were our conversations.&nbsp; I have been eating candy from her jar for over 9 years, and I now consider her my St. Louis mom.&nbsp; I cannot say enough about her, but her selflessness, devotion as a friend, and her faith are inspiring.&nbsp; She is sweeter than any candy in that jar.  5) Letters from students: There were more days than I can count when I walked out of a classroom not happy with the way the class had gone. Blaming myself, I would question: Maybe I should have prepared more? Maybe I should have been more challenging? (the list goes on....). I would assume I am not alone and that all good teachers go through this self-evaluation.&nbsp; However, I am saving several heartfelt letters from students who have no idea how much I valued their expressions. A teacher will never know how many hearts and minds they have touched, but I am thankful for those students who let me know that I had.  We all pack our bags at one time or another. Enjoy the process.",

If I was trying to lose weight,  it would  be in my best interest to look at other &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; foods and  perhaps  weigh their history more than their calories. <strong>Commandment 2: Strategy is Stronger than Willpower<\/strong> My successful weight loss clients aren't the ones with the most  &ldquo;willpower,\" but those with the most strategies. They plan ahead.  Example 1: Their grocery store lists include healthy snacks instead   of depending on the vending machine at 3pm to come up with a nutritious   75 cent selection.  Example 2: They set up a weekly exercise buddy, so when their 5am   alarm goes off&hellip;it&rsquo;s not the willpower that gets them to throw off the  cover, it 's the friend waiting for them at the park.&nbsp; Strategy =  Success. <strong>Commandment 3: Separate Mood from Food<\/strong> Sad?

Cereal.&nbsp; If eating is dictated   by your mood, any weight lyou lose could easily be regained time and   time again until the mood is separated from food.&nbsp; Does food ever solve  the problem? If you address the emotion with the right  response, the  result will be guilt-free and empowering. <strong>Commandment 4: The slips should teach you, not defeat you.<\/strong> It took years to create unhealthy habits, therefore it only makes   sense that it takes months and years to re-script new ones.&nbsp; We learn   from slip ups.

When I read the article about \"20 salads that are worse than a Whopper,\" I was shocked. I would have ordered several of these salads not thinking twice that I was consuming all of the calories in my salad bowl that I needed for the day. However, what I found out, was that more often than not, &nbsp;many salads at chain restaurants have more calories (a lot more calories) than our friend's loaded burger.  Restaurants are savvy and know that nutrition \"sells\" these days. The number of salads being offered on menus continues to grow and they promote their salads as healthy alternatives to other items on their menus. &nbsp;Menus even boast that their salads are \"light\" or \"healthy.\" &nbsp; However, that couldn't be farther from the truth, many of these salads contain over 800 calories and 50 grams of fat.  One might ask, how could a SALAD have so many calories? &nbsp;Part of the reason salad calories are so high, is the sheer size of the salad bowl. &nbsp;These salad troughs can hold not only a lot of spinach leaves, but also have plenty of room for cups of &nbsp;cheese, croutons, nuts, dried fruit, and the biggest calorie drencher...salad dressing. &nbsp;In order to coat all of these ingredients, it could take 1\/2 a cup of salad dressing easily = 400 calories.  Here are some tips to keep you from falling prey to &nbsp;salad sabotage:  1) Check out the calories ahead of time. &nbsp;Restaurant websites are providing calorie counts on menu items, and nutrient analysis websites such as <a href=\"www.calorieking.com\">www.calorieking.com<\/a> are up to date with restaurant food calories as well.  2) Order 1\/2 a salad and round it out with a broth-based &nbsp;soup.  3) Take control and ask for dressings to be put on the side, for the chef to go light on the cheese, or leave off ingredients that you could live without.  4) Choose salads that list more &nbsp;vegetables in the description than &nbsp;\"condiment\" like ingredients, such as dried fruit, candied nuts, cheese, croutons, and bacon.  Next time as you pass up what you really want on the menu, and tell the waiter with a sigh that you will \"just have a salad..., \" check out the&nbsp;astonishing&nbsp;calorie numbers below, and perhaps...the 500 calorie burger is &nbsp;the lightest thing on the menu...  1. Einstein Bros Bistro Salad with Chicken: 940 calories  2. Applebee's Grilled Shrimp and Spinach Salad: 1,050  3. California Pizza Kitchen Field Greens Salad with Gorgonzola Cheese: 1,360  4. California Pizza Kitchen Thai Crunch Salad with Fresh Avocado: 1,399  5. T.G.I.

When I read the article about \"20 salads that are worse than a Whopper,\" I was shocked. I would have ordered several of these salads not thinking twice that I was consuming all of the calories in my salad bowl that I needed for the day. However, what I found out, was that more often than not, &nbsp;many salads at chain restaurants have more calories (a lot more calories) than our friend's loaded burger.  Restaurants are savvy and know that nutrition \"sells\" these days. The number of salads being offered on menus continues to grow and they promote their salads as healthy alternatives to other items on their menus. &nbsp;Menus even boast that their salads are \"light\" or \"healthy.\" &nbsp; However, that couldn't be farther from the truth, many of these salads contain over 800 calories and 50 grams of fat.  One might ask, how could a SALAD have so many calories? &nbsp;Part of the reason salad calories are so high, is the sheer size of the salad bowl. &nbsp;These salad troughs can hold not only a lot of spinach leaves, but also have plenty of room for cups of &nbsp;cheese, croutons, nuts, dried fruit, and the biggest calorie drencher...salad dressing. &nbsp;In order to coat all of these ingredients, it could take 1\/2 a cup of salad dressing easily = 400 calories.  Here are some tips to keep you from falling prey to &nbsp;salad sabotage:  1) Check out the calories ahead of time. &nbsp;Restaurant websites are providing calorie counts on menu items, and nutrient analysis websites such as www.calorieking.com are up to date with restaurant food calories as well.  2) Order 1\/2 a salad and round it out with a broth-based &nbsp;soup.  3) Take control and ask for dressings to be put on the side, for the chef to go light on the cheese, or leave off ingredients that you could live without.  4) Choose salads that list more &nbsp;vegetables in the description than &nbsp;\"condiment\" like ingredients, such as dried fruit, candied nuts, cheese, croutons, and bacon.  Next time as you pass up what you really want on the menu, and tell the waiter with a sigh that you will \"just have a salad..., \" check out the&nbsp;astonishing&nbsp;calorie numbers below, and perhaps...the 500 calorie burger is &nbsp;the lightest thing on the menu...  1. Einstein Bros Bistro Salad with Chicken: 940 calories  2. Applebee's Grilled Shrimp and Spinach Salad: 1,050  3. California Pizza Kitchen Field Greens Salad with Gorgonzola Cheese: 1,360  4. California Pizza Kitchen Thai Crunch Salad with Fresh Avocado: 1,399  5. T.G.I. Friday's Santa Fe Chopped Salad: 1,800 calories  For the other 15 salads check out: 20 Salads Worse than a Whopper",

Those who ate the egg breakfast lost more weight, and in particular more weight around their waist than those who ate the bagel breakfast. <strong>TAKE HOME:<\/strong> Pay attention to your hunger level after you eat breakfast. &nbsp;If &nbsp;your stomach talks just one hour after eating, &nbsp;re-forumualte your breakfast plate. <strong>3) Shrink by 20%.<\/strong> Perhaps, slightly shrinking your morning breakfast is an easy way to decrease your overall calorie intake, but shrink minimally. &nbsp;If you shrink beyond 20%, your stomach will notice, and it might lead to over eating at the next meal or later that evening.

I am pretty sure bacon will not be one of those foods that turns out to be healthier than we thought. &nbsp;The current health advice to treat bacon more as condiment or an occasional food for 3 reasons: 1) 68% of its calories come from fat...and not the heart healthy kind &nbsp;2) it is high in sodium 3) it is a processed meat (like hot dogs, turkey bacon, etc) which contains preservatives such as nitrates and other chemicals that have been shown to promote cancer growth. &nbsp;The Institute of Cancer states that no level of processed meats can be considered safe.  On the bright side, &nbsp;2 strips of bacon contain only 140 calories, and its healthier than its breakfast competition, sausage.  If there is a way to \"healthfully\" eat bacon, here are my tips:  1) Bake or microwave your bacon. &nbsp;Baking or nuking your bacon decreases the fat and calories by almost 1\/2 and also lessens the formation of nitrosamines (cancer causing agents) to form. &nbsp;You are less likely to char your bacon in the microwave or oven which also reduces the amount of nitrate chemicals as well.  2) Choose an alternative bacon. While turkey bacon does have less calories and fat (about 50% less) it typically has more sodium. &nbsp;When we have bacon in our house, I prefer to go with the real thing, center cut (which has more meat than fat) and pay a couple extra pennies for the nitrate and antibiotic free bacon.  3) Pair it with some veggies. The antioxidants present in vegetables will help balance out &nbsp;free-radical damage that occurs from the nitrate chemicals found in the bacon.

                        "content" => "<p> Congratulations! You have accomplished the most challenging part of running a marathon...the training! Through this training journey, not only are you both mentally and physically tougher, but you also most likely have a better sense of how to \"fuel\" your running machine.  Now that the bulk of your work is over, and running has significantly decreased, you might be wondering how your nutritional game&nbsp;plan should also be adjusted. It is possible while the milage has tapered, your appetite has not! &nbsp;You might be asking yourself questions like: Should you be downing Gatorade days before the race? Eating pasta for breakfast, lunch, and dinner? To help you nutritionally navigate the week before race day, check out these tips:  <strong>1.  Train less. Eat less.<\/strong> To avoid race day weight gain, your overall calorie intake should be less than what it was while in peak training.  If your appetite is still in high gear, eat often so your brain knows those calories will be coming in on a regular basis, increase your vegetable intake (see FIBER section below), and increase healthy, filling fats such as carrots dunked in guacamole and nuts and fruit for snacks. <strong>2. Create Your Two-Day Game Plan<\/strong> <strong>Two to three days before the marathon<\/strong> , think ahead about the following dietary considerations: <strong>FLUIDS<\/strong> : Fluid intake should be similar to what you have practiced during training.  Significantly increasing your fluids  1-2 days before the event could possibly lead to over hydration and consequently low levels of sodium and other electrolytes. Adequate hydration is characterized by pale yellow colored urine, and bathroom visits every 2-3 hours. There is no need to \"load\" up on fluids. <strong>FIBER:<\/strong> While a high-fiber diet is recommended for general good health, it is not ideal for you 2-3 days before the race (or runners behind you).  Avoid high fiber foods such as beans, cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts, high-fiber cereals such as Kashi or bran flakes. &nbsp;Other foods like might be problematic include spicy foods, high-fat foods, chocolate, etc. &nbsp;You know your body best. Eliminate &nbsp;those &nbsp;foods 3 days before the race.   <strong>CARBS<\/strong> : Carbohydrate loading is a way of eating to load the muscles and liver with stored carbohydrate and extend endurance performance in events of 90 minutes or longer.  While studies have proven that carbohydrate loading can work, it might not be the optimal practice for you if you have not tried it during regular training. &nbsp;Potential drawbacks of carb loading is a feeling of \"heaviness\" due to water weight associated with carb intake and an   increased risk of GI distress i.e.: &nbsp;extra porta potty visits.&nbsp;The   latest protocol for carbohydrate loading is to consume 10-12 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight (i.e.: 150 pound individual would have to consume 680 grams of CHO) 2-3 days prior to race day. &nbsp;For example, if race day was Sunday, carb consumption should be 680 grams on both Friday and Saturday. Studies have also shown that carb loading can be accomplished on days 4 or 5 prior to the event (i.e.: Wednesday and Thursday) with \"normal\" carb consumption on days Friday and Saturday before the race. This could relieve some of the \"heaviness\" associated with carb loading.   For a thorough summary of carb loading: read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.powerbar.com\/articles\/224\/carbohydrate-loading.aspx\">here<\/a> .   Whether you chose to load or not, I do recommend increasing carb intake 2 days prior to race day. Here is an example of how to do this: Breakfast: Peanut butter sandwich with an egg (ADD BANANA) Snacks: Nuts (ADD A PIECE OF FRUIT) Lunch: Turkey sub with carrots and apple (ADD A SPORTS DRINK) Dinner: Chicken and rice with zucchini (ADD 1\/2 A CUP MORE OF RICE TO DINNER)  Spreading your carb intake throughout the day versus piling on the pasta the night before ensures a more settled stomach on race day morning.    <strong>3. Have NEOPHOBIA<\/strong> : A runner should have neophobia (fear of new things) leading up to marathon day, and this includes foods! Stick with the tried and true meals you have eaten during training. If you are traveling to a race, think about bringing foods from home. Another unforeseen hiccup is the marathon expo! With hundreds of bite-sized samples of gels, bars, drinks, waffles, and jelly beans, you might be tempted to try out the latest and greatest sports supplement only to find out the dozens of samplings you tried created a perfect recipe for an upset stomach. <strong>4. Plan Out Your RACE DAY FUEL:<\/strong> Race day fuel (most likely breakfast) should once again be a tried and true meal that you have eaten before long training runs. &nbsp;If possible, it is helpful to eat a carbohydrate-rich meal 3 hours before the race. A 3-hour window allows for optimal fuel utilization, and minimizes potential GI distress. This practice is also important for nervous nelly runners like myself to get the food down without causing nerve-related stomach issues. In addition to solids, you should also consume 16-24 ounces of fluids two to three hours before the race. I recommend using a sports drink as a way to combine both carbs, fluids and sodium. Ten to fifteen minutes prior to the start, top off your fluids with 6-8 additional ounces of a sports drink. <strong>CONGRATS!<\/strong> You have come so far, now keep up the dedication and think through your nutritional game plan with wise food choices! You will be both physically and mentally ready for each 26.2 mile! <\/p>",

                        "content" => "<p>Athletes who aim to get stronger with each quality workout know the importance of recovery nutrition. A recovery nutrition plan is particularly critical after a long or intense training workout. Minutes\/hours after a session, your body&rsquo;s blood flow to the muscles is greater and presents a window of opportunity to fuel, restock energy, and repair working muscles. Recovery nutrition becomes even more essential for athletes who train twice a day or have a limited amount of time (6-24 hours) to recover. The ideal recovery food\/beverage contains carbohydrates to restore glycogen (muscle&rsquo;s energy source), essential amino acids to promote muscle protein synthesis\/repair, and fluids to rehydrate. The number of recovery drinks on the shelves is endless, but is there a comparable drink that you could find at a fraction of the price and also look forward to drinking? The answer is sweet: low-fat chocolate milk. Studies have been conducted on chocolate milk as a recovery drink and not only did athletes perform well, they performed better compared to other formulated sports recovery products. Low-fat chocolate milk has an impressive nutritional resume for recovery. It contains an ideal carb to protein ratio of 3:1, both slow (casein) and fast (whey) digesting proteins for quick and sustaining protein fuel, and important vitamins and minerals that American&rsquo;s diets tend to fall short in: calcium, vitamin D, and potassium. Some might say the only real difference between chocolate milk and a recovery drink is the cost. Even with selecting a higher priced organic milk, you would still pay 50% less compared to most formulated products. In the end, most formulated recovery drinks are a perfectly suitable beverage, and may be more convenient at times than something like refrigerated chocolate milk. Chocolate milk is not going to be appropriate for athletes with lactose intolerance or sensitivities. As a sports dietitian, I recommend that my athletes drink about 10 oz. of low-fat organic chocolate milk after a hard\/long workout to obtain 200 calories, 10 grams of protein, 33 grams of carbohydrate and 3 grams of fat within 30-45 minutes. So go ahead, and sport that chocolate stache!<\/p>",

For some, the combination of these events can set up a bad case of the winter blues. While you might feel the urge to lie in a tanning bed or plow into a bag of chips, there are healthier ways to boost your mood during the winter months. The purpose of January&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nutrition Connection&rdquo; is to summarize the science about \"feel good foods\" and offer tips on how to maximize these nutrients in your own diet.<\/p><p><br \/><strong>Omega-3&rsquo;s (EPA &amp; DHA)<\/strong><br \/>Research continues to mound regarding omega-3 fat's and their ability to combat depression and optimize mental health. This relationship makes good sense as our brain and nervous system is largely made up of fats. Omega-3's are referred to as \"essential\" because they cannot be made by our body and must be obtained through the diet. Studies show that omega-3&rsquo;s can improve different types of depression and also be beneficial at various stages of life, for example, during and after pregnancy.<\/p><p>Eating fish and fatty fish in particular, such as salmon or tuna, is the easiest way to meet your omega-3 requirements. Current recommendations for adults and children is 2-3 servings (4-6 oz.) of fish per week which is equivalent to ~500 mg of omega-3&rsquo;s per day. For those who don&rsquo;t enjoy fish or seafood, fish oil supplements can be a good backup plan. 1000 mg of EPA + DHA in supplement form have been shown to be effective. Always consult with your physician about changes to your supplement regimen.<br \/>*Little tip: If you are plagued by the fish pill burp, chill your pills in the freezer before you take them, just make sure you don't forget about them!<\/p><p><strong>Vitamin D<\/strong><br \/>Vitamin D is often referred to as the \"sunshine vitamin\" because our body can make vitamin D from sunlight. Vitamin D levels often dip during the wintertime due to the less daylight, indoor activity, and challenge in obtaining enough vitamin D through foods such as fatty fish, milk, eggs and fortified foods. Low levels of vitamin D are often associated with mood disorders such as depression and seasonal affective disorder. Statistics show that 75% of adults may be deficient in D. Therefore, as a dietitian, I often recommend that people get their vitamin D levels checked. Optimal levels should fall in the range of 40-60 ng\/dl of 25(OH) vitamin D. Supplementation is often warranted and most health professionals would agree that a dose of 600-1000 IU of D3 is appropriate. If your blood levels fall short, your physician may put you on a mega dose of D for several months before returning to the over counter dosage.<\/p><p><strong>Cold &amp; Flu Foods<\/strong><\/p><p>The best line of defense during the winter season is a balanced diet, rich in variety and color. Not only will these foods protect you with a coat of armor, they also might ease any symptoms of a contracted cold or flu bug. Here are three of my top cold and flu protective picks to keep on your grocery list.<\/p><p><strong>Chicken Noodle Soup<\/strong>: Mom&rsquo;s homemade soup might be just what the doctor ordered. Soups typically contain a salty broth, which both hydrates and thins mucus secretions. The warm liquids allow congestion to break up and expedites the removal of germs from the body. Make sure to add in lots of vegetables and lean proteins to boost micronutrients such as vitamin C, A, iron and zinc, all important immunity fighters.<\/p><p><strong>Garlic<\/strong>: Vampires and viruses beware! A compound in garlic, called allicin, has both anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. Studies have shown that both raw, cooked &amp; garlic pill supplements can help speed up recovery by boosting T-cells in our blood stream. If all else fails, your super garlicky breath will at least keep infectious people at arms reach.<\/p><p><strong>Tea<\/strong>: Just like soup, the warm and soothing liquid helps mend sore throats, and certain teas, such as black and green teas contain EGCG a compound which has been shown to keep viruses from reproducing.<\/p><p><strong>Summing It Up<\/strong><br \/>While the cold weather might inspire overeating and inactivity, fight back with immune, mood boosting foods and winter exercise. Your body will thank you.<\/p><p><strong>Spice-Rubbed Roasted Salmon with Lemon-Garlic Spinach<\/strong><\/p><p><strong><\/strong>Yield: 6 servings (serving size: about 4 1\/2 oz salmon and 1\/3 cup spinach mixture)<\/p><p><strong>Ingredients:<\/strong><br \/>1\/2 tsp. salt<br \/>1\/2 tsp. cumin<br \/>1\/2 tsp. coriander<br \/>1\/4 tsp. paprika<br \/>1\/8 tsp. cinnamon<br \/>1\/8 tsp. black pepper<br \/>1 (2-1\/4-pound) skinless salmon<br \/>2 cups thinly sliced onion<br \/>Spinach:<br \/>1 tsp. olive oil<br \/>2 garlic cloves, minced<br \/>2 (6-ounce) packages fresh baby spinach<br \/>1 tsp. grated lemon rind<br \/>1\/4 tsp. salt<br \/>1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice<br \/>Remaining ingredients:<br \/>2 Tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro<br \/>Lemon wedges<br \/><strong><\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Preparation<\/strong><br \/>1. Preheat oven to 400&deg;.<br \/>2. To prepare salmon, combine first 6 ingredients; rub spice mixture evenly over fish. Place onion in an 11 x 7-inch baking dish coated with cooking spray. Place fish on top of onion; bake at 400&deg; for 20 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork or until desired degree of doneness.<br \/>3. To prepare spinach, heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic to pan; cook 1 minute. Add half of spinach; cook for 1 minute, stirring frequently. Add remaining spinach; cook 4 minutes or until wilted, stirring frequently. Sprinkle spinach mixture with rind and 1\/4 teaspoon salt. Stir in juice; remove from heat.<br \/>4. Place salmon on a platter. Arrange onions and spinach evenly around salmon. Sprinkle salmon with chopped fresh cilantro.

Vitamin DVitamin D is often referred to as the \"sunshine vitamin\" because our body can make vitamin D from sunlight. Vitamin D levels often dip during the wintertime due to the less daylight, indoor activity, and challenge in obtaining enough vitamin D through foods such as fatty fish, milk, eggs and fortified foods. Low levels of vitamin D are often associated with mood disorders such as depression and seasonal affective disorder. Statistics show that 75% of adults may be deficient in D. Therefore, as a dietitian, I often recommend that people get their vitamin D levels checked. Optimal levels should fall in the range of 40-60 ng\/dl of 25(OH) vitamin D. Supplementation is often warranted and most health professionals would agree that a dose of 600-1000 IU of D3 is appropriate. If your blood levels fall short, your physician may put you on a mega dose of D for several months before returning to the over counter dosage.
Cold &amp; Flu Foods
The best line of defense during the winter season is a balanced diet, rich in variety and color. Not only will these foods protect you with a coat of armor, they also might ease any symptoms of a contracted cold or flu bug. Here are three of my top cold and flu protective picks to keep on your grocery list.
Chicken Noodle Soup: Mom&rsquo;s homemade soup might be just what the doctor ordered. Soups typically contain a salty broth, which both hydrates and thins mucus secretions. The warm liquids allow congestion to break up and expedites the removal of germs from the body. Make sure to add in lots of vegetables and lean proteins to boost micronutrients such as vitamin C, A, iron and zinc, all important immunity fighters.
Garlic: Vampires and viruses beware! A compound in garlic, called allicin, has both anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. Studies have shown that both raw, cooked &amp; garlic pill supplements can help speed up recovery by boosting T-cells in our blood stream. If all else fails, your super garlicky breath will at least keep infectious people at arms reach.
Tea: Just like soup, the warm and soothing liquid helps mend sore throats, and certain teas, such as black and green teas contain EGCG a compound which has been shown to keep viruses from reproducing.
Summing It UpWhile the cold weather might inspire overeating and inactivity, fight back with immune, mood boosting foods and winter exercise. Your body will thank you.

Myth: A low-fat diet prevents heart disease.
Currently, a diet called the Mediterranean Diet is in the press for a recently published study that showed it was able to reduce heart disease by 30% compared to a more traditional low-fat diet. This diet is much more judicious in fats such as fish fats, nuts, avocados, and olive oil and is also rich in fruits, vegetables and plant proteins.

Moral of the story swap in Mediterranean fats and swap out some junk!&nbsp;
Myth: There is no need to worry about salt if you have fat in check
Sodium reduction is key to a healthy heart. We have evidence that just 30 minutes after eating a salty meal, blood vessels constrict. This reaction is seen even in the healthiest individual! Overtime, a chronic, high-sodium diet can result in high blood pressure and heart disease.&nbsp;
The current recommendation is to take in no more than 2300 mg of sodium, and for some people less than 1500 mg of sodium. &nbsp;Most of us get 2-3 times this much sodium on a daily basis. If you were to change just ONE habit to reduce sodium, a good choice would be to cook more at home. Seventy-seven percent of the sodium in our diet comes from processed and restaurant foods.&nbsp;
Myth: If the label states it is \"trans fat free\" it is safe to eat.&nbsp;
Trans fats are the true villains in the world of fats because they increase our bad cholesterol and lower our good cholesterol. &nbsp;The current recommendation is to aim for no more than 2 grams a day, and most health professionals would recommend you aim for 0 grams!&nbsp;
The tricky part with trans fats is identifying them on food labels. Under FDA label regulations, if a serving of food contains 0.5 grams or less trans fats, the label can state it is \"trans fat free.\" However, if, for example one serving of creamer contains 0.4 mg of trans fats per serving and you have 3-4 cups of coffee with cream, you have now blown past the trans fat recommendation.&nbsp;
The easiest way to spot trans fats is to scan the ingredient list and look for the word &ldquo;hydrogenated oil&rdquo; which is an indicator that trans fats lurk in the food.
Myth: If I am going to drink alcohol, I should go with red wine for heart health.&nbsp;
While red wine in moderation can be good for the heart, the benefits are not limited to red wine. Any alcoholic beverage such as white wine, beer or liquor can potentially be heart protective. However, the benefits are dose- dependent. Drinking more than two servings (5 oz. glasses of wine, 12 oz. beer or 1.5 oz. liquor) can have the opposite effect, putting you at higher risks for heart disease and cancer.&nbsp;
Cheers to good heart health!&nbsp;

Cut out Processed Carbs from ONE (or more) Meals
Processed carbs like bread, pasta, pretzels, crackers, cereal, and chips, (the list goes on) are foods that are easy to overeat, yet don&rsquo;t offer much of a nutritional punch. Remove those foods from one (or more) meals, each day. As an example, swap out refined grains like Special K cereal and toast for two hardboiled eggs and a bowl of fruit for breakfast. At dinner, double up on the vegetables and leave off the white rice or pasta. Instead of pretzels for a salty snack, substitute edamame for a similar, yet satisfying and healthier snack. Keep your goal reasonable by addressing only one meal at a time, unless you feel you can tackle more than this. 
Be Aware of and RE-WRITE your &ldquo;Eating Scripts&rdquo; 
In Brian Wainsink&rsquo;s book, Mindless Eating, the food psychologist describes repetitive and unconscious eating patterns as &ldquo;eating scripts.&rdquo; An example of an eating script might be the bowl of ice cream you always serve yourself after dinner while you wind down watching TV. Another common script is raiding the pantry as soon as you get home from work while prepping dinner. 
What are your &ldquo;eating scripts?&rdquo; How can you re-write that script to help you eat less or eat better and bring more mindfulness to eating? Re-writing the above mentioned scripts would look like this: 


Enlist your spouse for an after dinner walk 2-3 nights a week instead of sitting down to the TV. (notice I didn&rsquo;t say every night...start small) 


Pack a satisfying snack to eat on the way home from work. It will take the edge off of your hunger and stop that post work pantry raid. 


Add in More Green 
Dieting is often associated with &ldquo;removing&rdquo; foods from our diet, but lets change that mindset and &ldquo;add-in&rdquo; something healthy. Coloring your plate with a bit of green at every meal ensures not only a plate-full of nutritious additions, but can also facilitate weight loss. Packed with water&nbsp;and fiber, green vegetables are low in calories. As an example, 1 cup of sliced zucchini = 25 calories compared to 200 calories = 1 cup of pasta. Here are several simple meal ideas to add in green!






Breakfast: Add spinach or arugula to eggs; add a handful of spinach to a fruit smoothie Snacks: Substitute Kale Chips for potato chips; dip raw sugar snap peas into hummus Lunch: Toss sliced cucumbers in a 2 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar, 1 Tbsp. olive oil and 1 tsp. of honey for a simple salad side dish Dinner: Add finely chopped kale or Swiss chard to tomato sauce; vary up your typical dinner salad with a&nbsp;spinach salad.",

You might be surprised and find it easier and more rewarding than imagined! I do not believe that journaling is a task that is required for life, but it is especially useful when you initiate a new eating plan or simply need to get back on &ldquo;track.&rdquo; <\/span><\/p><p><span>Working closely with clients and their on-line journals, I have found the following sites to be user-friendly, have a large database of foods choices, and provide tailored and personalized feedback: &ldquo;Lose <\/span><span>It&rdquo; <\/span><span>(available <\/span><span>on-line and iPhones) <\/span><span>&amp; &ldquo;My <\/span><span>Fitness Pal&rdquo; <\/span><span>(available <\/span><span>on-line and multiple smart phones). <\/span><span>Regardless of the on-line journal you decide to use, read on for <\/span><span>tips to make the most out of your journaling experience. <\/span><\/p><p><span><strong>Getting Started<\/strong>: <\/span><span>Once you have created a username and password for your program, you will enter your age, gender, height, current and goal weight, and activity to determine your daily calorie goal. For those seeking weight loss, most <\/span><span>sound <\/span><span>programs will limit maximum weight lost to 2 pounds per week. Losing more than 2 pounds per week is typically attributed water loss and lean tissue (muscle), which is not the goal! <\/span><\/p><p><span><strong>Logging Foods<\/strong>: <\/span><span>An important feature of any on-line journal is the number of food choices in the database. With both &ldquo;Lose It&rdquo; and &ldquo;My Fitness Pal,&rdquo; you can easily locate a wide variety of both store\/name brands and restaurant-based food choices. I often find my clients get frustrated when they cannot find the <\/span><span>exact <\/span><span>food in the database, such as a lasagna dish from&nbsp;<\/span>the mom &amp; pop restaurant they often frequent. It is important to note that the goal of logging your foods is not to find the exact food match, but to find a food similar in portion and main ingredients. The sheer act of logging is what supports your health goals, not the accuracy of every entry.<\/p><p><span>If you eat like most of us, the range of your food choices (especially at breakfast and lunch) is small. We often eat the same foods over and over. Due to that fact, after logging for 1-2 weeks, you might find that journaling takes significantly less time then it did when you started. Once foods have been entered, they are put into a &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; category making the food or meal easy to find and add. <\/span><\/p><p><span><strong>Tracking Exercise<\/strong>: <\/span><span>In addition to logging your foods, programs offer the option to enter physical activity as well. Most programs will give you additional calories to eat based on how much exercise you completed. As an example, if your calorie goal was originally 1500 calories, and you burned 300 calories in exercise, you will now be granted 1800 calories for the day. If your goal is weight loss, I often caution my clients to indulge in their exercise calories for two reasons: 1) many on-line programs overestimate the amount of calories we burn in exercise 2) sticking with the goal calorie budget (1500 calories, in this case) will allow you to lose the weight at a faster rate. Remember, it is much easier to EAT 300 calories than burn 300 calories in a 3-mile run. <\/span><\/p><p><span><strong>Goals<\/strong>: <\/span><span>Another valuable feature of online journals\/apps is the ability to log daily weights. I encourage my clients to weigh often (weighing <\/span><span>in the buff, first thing in morning, after using the restroom is the most accurate way to do this). <\/span><span>While weighing daily might not be for everyone, the act of recording morning weights supports awareness and accountability. It is important to know that weight is affected by hydration status, glycogen storage (1 gram of carbohydrate holds on to ~3 grams of water), &ldquo;waste&rdquo; in your body, and hormones. It is very normal for a weight to bounce between 1-4 pounds on a daily basis. Accept that fluctuations in weight are normal, and the real emphasis should be on weight <\/span><span>trends over time. <\/span><\/p><p><span><strong>Beyond the Numbers<\/strong>: <\/span><span>Logging your daily intake and receiving quantitative feedback is motivating for many, but I also believe the lesson goes beyond the numbers. Honest logging allows you to face potential emotional and mindless eating, and encourages you to &ldquo;pause&rdquo; before putting something in your mouth if you have to record it. Embrace these savvy tools to as an opportunity to learn and grow in your journey to good health! <\/span><\/p><p><strong>Asparagus Ribbons with Lemon and Goat Cheese<\/strong><\/p><p><span>Creamy goat cheese crowns a refreshingly bracing salad.

I do not believe that journaling is a task that is required for life, but it is especially useful when you initiate a new eating plan or simply need to get back on &ldquo;track.&rdquo; 
Working closely with clients and their on-line journals, I have found the following sites to be user-friendly, have a large database of foods choices, and provide tailored and personalized feedback: &ldquo;Lose It&rdquo; (available on-line and iPhones) &amp; &ldquo;My Fitness Pal&rdquo; (available on-line and multiple smart phones). Regardless of the on-line journal you decide to use, read on for tips to make the most out of your journaling experience. 
Getting Started: Once you have created a username and password for your program, you will enter your age, gender, height, current and goal weight, and activity to determine your daily calorie goal. For those seeking weight loss, most sound programs will limit maximum weight lost to 2 pounds per week. Losing more than 2 pounds per week is typically attributed water loss and lean tissue (muscle), which is not the goal! 
Logging Foods: An important feature of any on-line journal is the number of food choices in the database. With both &ldquo;Lose It&rdquo; and &ldquo;My Fitness Pal,&rdquo; you can easily locate a wide variety of both store\/name brands and restaurant-based food choices. I often find my clients get frustrated when they cannot find the exact food in the database, such as a lasagna dish from&nbsp;the mom &amp; pop restaurant they often frequent. It is important to note that the goal of logging your foods is not to find the exact food match, but to find a food similar in portion and main ingredients. The sheer act of logging is what supports your health goals, not the accuracy of every entry.
If you eat like most of us, the range of your food choices (especially at breakfast and lunch) is small. We often eat the same foods over and over. Due to that fact, after logging for 1-2 weeks, you might find that journaling takes significantly less time then it did when you started. Once foods have been entered, they are put into a &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; category making the food or meal easy to find and add. 
Tracking Exercise: In addition to logging your foods, programs offer the option to enter physical activity as well. Most programs will give you additional calories to eat based on how much exercise you completed. As an example, if your calorie goal was originally 1500 calories, and you burned 300 calories in exercise, you will now be granted 1800 calories for the day. If your goal is weight loss, I often caution my clients to indulge in their exercise calories for two reasons: 1) many on-line programs overestimate the amount of calories we burn in exercise 2) sticking with the goal calorie budget (1500 calories, in this case) will allow you to lose the weight at a faster rate. Remember, it is much easier to EAT 300 calories than burn 300 calories in a 3-mile run. 
Goals: Another valuable feature of online journals\/apps is the ability to log daily weights. I encourage my clients to weigh often (weighing in the buff, first thing in morning, after using the restroom is the most accurate way to do this). While weighing daily might not be for everyone, the act of recording morning weights supports awareness and accountability. It is important to know that weight is affected by hydration status, glycogen storage (1 gram of carbohydrate holds on to ~3 grams of water), &ldquo;waste&rdquo; in your body, and hormones. It is very normal for a weight to bounce between 1-4 pounds on a daily basis. Accept that fluctuations in weight are normal, and the real emphasis should be on weight trends over time. 
Beyond the Numbers: Logging your daily intake and receiving quantitative feedback is motivating for many, but I also believe the lesson goes beyond the numbers. Honest logging allows you to face potential emotional and mindless eating, and encourages you to &ldquo;pause&rdquo; before putting something in your mouth if you have to record it. Embrace these savvy tools to as an opportunity to learn and grow in your journey to good health! 
Asparagus Ribbons with Lemon and Goat Cheese
Creamy goat cheese crowns a refreshingly bracing salad. Because the asparagus is shaved, it does not have to be cooked. Thick asparagus spears work best when it comes to making ribbons like these. 
Source: Cooking Light JULY 2007 
Yield: 8 servings (serving size: 1\/2 cup) 

Ingredients
1 pound large asparagus spears, trimmed 1 1\/2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved 
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil 
1\/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1\/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard 
1\/4 teaspoon sugar 
1\/4 teaspoon salt 
1\/2 cup (2 ounces) crumbled goat cheese
Directions&nbsp;
Hold each asparagus spear by the tip end. Shave asparagus into ribbons with a vegetable peeler to measure 3 cups. Reserve asparagus tips for another use. Combine asparagus and tomatoes in a medium bowl. 
Combine chives and next 6 ingredients (through 1\/4 teaspoon salt), stirring with a whisk. Drizzle over the asparagus mixture, tossing gently to coat. Top with goat cheese.&nbsp;",

No Green Here
Over 86% of water bottles end up in our trash, and it takes hundreds of years for these buried water bottles to degrade.&nbsp; So why not recycle?&nbsp; Approximately 40% of those recycled bottles are exported to other countries for processing, and not only does this processing produce toxic gas, but is also fuel consuming.&nbsp; It takes 1.5 million barrels of oil to produce the natural gas and petroleum-made bottles of water we drink each year. That is enough to fuel 100,000 US cars.&nbsp;
What if you reuse and wash the bottle? Unfortunately, the practice of re-using the water bottle is not necessarily safe. Not properly washing the bottle can cause you to get sick, and washing them appropriately (at a high temperature) causes the breakdown of the plastic. Most bottles were designed to be used once. Through proper cleaning, the plastic begins to breakdown and allow a chemical called phthalates (added to the plastic to keep it flexible) end up in the water. Phthalates act like hormones and have been shown to cause hormone imbalances in both humans and animals. More research is needed to examine concerns with our intake of this chemical.
But Isn&rsquo;t Bottled Water More Safe? 
Tap water is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA actually has more strict guidelines for tap water than the Food and Drug Administration, who regulates bottled water can enforce. In fact, bottled water can contain many components that are not tolerated in municipal water. In addition, nearly 40 percent of bottled water IS just filtered or treated tap water.&nbsp; Dansani, a product of Coca-Cola &amp; Aquafina, a Pepsi-Co product have been in the news for mis-marketing their bottled water and admitted that the letters &ldquo;PWS&rdquo; on the label stands for &ldquo;Public Water Source&rdquo;. Lucky for us, and particularly those who live in Saint Louis, MO, (Saint Louis won the 2007 award for the best tasting city water in the country) we have the cleanest and safest water in the world.
And it's cheaper&hellip;
If you met your water needs through bottled water, you would be spending $1,400 per year compared with 49 cents for the same volume of tap water.&nbsp;
So, keep drinking your water, just do it the old-fashioned way and use a glass.

Read on for TOP Exercise Pitfalls and&nbsp;a recipe for Quinoa with Dried Cherries &amp; Pistachios&nbsp;

1)&nbsp;Eating is Easy, Exercise is LESS Easy. Most people would agree, it is &ldquo;easier&rdquo; to eat 100 calories than burn 100 calories through exercise! 100 calories adds up quickly when we grab a handful of M&amp;M&rsquo;s from the secretary&rsquo;s candy bowl or finish the French fries off our child&rsquo;s plate compared to the work it takes to burn 100 calories in a 30-minute gym workout.&nbsp;
2)&nbsp;Exercise-Induced Appetite.&nbsp; For many, exercise will naturally increase your appetite to eat. Whether or not we are aware of this appetite surge, we often respond by serving ourselves more, or grabbing an additional snack. Unfortunately, these small increases in food intake undo the calorie deficit we aimed to create.
3)&nbsp;Over-Estimated Exercise.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let them fool you, that elliptical or on-line exercise calorie calculator almost always overestimates how many calories you burn.&nbsp; These tools typically do not obtain enough personalized information to give you an accurate calorie count.&nbsp; Even though more sophisticated tools such as Garmin or Polar watches are more precise, they still are likely to overestimate calories burned.
4)&nbsp;Entitlement.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve all said something of the following to ourselves at one time or another: &ldquo;I can splurge on X because I trained for X minutes today.&rdquo;
Making the Most of Your Exercise
1)&nbsp;Do Exercise, Don&rsquo;t Extreme Diet.&nbsp; Exercising is a great way to lose weight because it doesn&rsquo;t slow your metabolism like slashing calories does.&nbsp; If you commit to a healthy balanced diet or make small calories cuts such as 100-200 calories per day, the weight should begin to come off.&nbsp; Significant calorie cutting has been shown to slow metabolism and therefore makes it both hard to lose and keep weight off.
2)&nbsp;Incorporate Interval Training. Interval training is a type of training that integrates short bursts of increased intensity into your workout.&nbsp; As example, instead of walking at a constant speed of 3.5 mph on the treadmill for 4 miles, incorporate short bursts of jogging or faster walking at 5.0 mph every 5 minutes or so.&nbsp; Interval bursts can be incorporated into any type of exercise and will cause you to burn more calories and become stronger.
3)&nbsp;Find Your Filler-UP Foods.&nbsp; Certain food calories fill us up more than others. Forty calories of broccoli are much more filling than 40 calories of chips.&nbsp; Figure out what foods fill you up.&nbsp; A simple eating strategy to use called the &ldquo;plate method,&rdquo; recommends that &nbsp;&frac12;&nbsp; your plate be filled with fiber-rich vegetables (i.e.: broccoli, spinach, zucchini), &frac14; with lean protein (i.e.: chicken, fish, soy), and &frac14; with a fiber-rich grain or starchy vegetable (i.e.: brown rice, quinoa*, sweet potato). A well-designed plate such as this, is not only satisfying, but also helps manage calories.
*see recipe below
4)&nbsp;Re-direct Your Focus: If you find yourself slaving over the elliptical machine or dragging yourself to Zumba class just for the sake of burning calories, pick another mode of exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Commit to physical activity that you will enjoy and look forward to doing.&nbsp; Choose to train for an event with a meaningful cause to you, such a 10K race, and surround yourself with others who enjoy and share similar goals.
5)&nbsp;Move Beyond the Numbers. Focus on other benefits of exercise beyond calories or your weight on the scale.&nbsp; Monitor body fat and muscle mass changes by having your body composition tested.&nbsp; Commend yourself on the new definition you notice in your arms, or the smaller pant size you fit into.&nbsp; Enjoy increased energy and\/or better sleep. These are all worthy benefits of a commitment to being more active.
Continue to be patient with yourself and realize that long-term weight loss is a journey.&nbsp; Enjoy the process and the exercise that gets you there.

                        "content" => "<p>Every June we celebrate our beloved fathers, and we also do a lot of summer grilling. One of my favorite food memories growing up was watching my Dad grill his famous barbequed chicken. It was a true labor of love as he took pride in every detail from preparing his secret tangy sauce to perfectly placing each coal. I watched him flip and turn each chicken inspecting it for cooked perfection, hoping for a sneak preview bite before anyone else. Grilling goes beyond a healthy and delicious way of cooking, but serves as a way to connect and enjoy the company of our family and friends.<\/p><p>While many of us love that charred flavor from the grill, we need to make sure our cooking technique is serving our health well. Recent attention has focused on the link between grilling and certain cancers such as stomach, colorectal, lung, and breast cancer. The culprits are cancer-causing agents called heterocyclic amines (HCA) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which are chemical substances that are formed when fat is heated to high temperatures.<\/p><p>So now what? Cut back on grilling and social cooking? Absolutely not. There are several tips you can follow to relieve your grilling woes, and it can all start with a <strong>tasty marinade<\/strong>.

                        "searchable" => "Every June we celebrate our beloved fathers, and we also do a lot of summer grilling. One of my favorite food memories growing up was watching my Dad grill his famous barbequed chicken. It was a true labor of love as he took pride in every detail from preparing his secret tangy sauce to perfectly placing each coal. I watched him flip and turn each chicken inspecting it for cooked perfection, hoping for a sneak preview bite before anyone else. Grilling goes beyond a healthy and delicious way of cooking, but serves as a way to connect and enjoy the company of our family and friends.
While many of us love that charred flavor from the grill, we need to make sure our cooking technique is serving our health well. Recent attention has focused on the link between grilling and certain cancers such as stomach, colorectal, lung, and breast cancer. The culprits are cancer-causing agents called heterocyclic amines (HCA) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which are chemical substances that are formed when fat is heated to high temperatures.
So now what? Cut back on grilling and social cooking? Absolutely not. There are several tips you can follow to relieve your grilling woes, and it can all start with a tasty marinade. A recent study from Kansas State University marinated the same cut of meat in 3 different marinades. The various marinades reduced these \"bad\" chemicals anywhere from 57-88%, quite a significant impact! Researchers suspect that the antioxidants in marinades, specifically the spices and herbs, are responsible for protecting against carcinogens. Herbs such as rosemary, sage, thyme, and oregano seem to be the best defenders.
Here are some additional steps for healthy grilling and a turkey burger recipe (which received rave reviews) that won&rsquo;t fall into any bland or dry stereotypes!
Be In-DIRECT. Avoid placing meats in direct contact with high flames or extreme heat through grilling, broiling, barbecuing, or frying.
Get Creative! Grill foods such as vegetables, veggie burgers, quesadillas, or even pizza. These foods contain little fat and can be a fun new food to introduce to the grill.
Flip often. Flipping your meats every minute or so reduces HCA&rsquo;s by almost 70%.
Buy Bone In: Choose lean and trimmed meats, but leave the bone in! A lean meat will cause less fat causing flare-ups, and leaving the bone in makes for a juicy meat.
Go Silver: Place meat on aluminum foil instead of directly on the grill to avoid juices into the fire or flames touching the meat. Not only does this help prevent charring, but it also makes for easy cleanup.
Keep a spray bottle handy: Tame those flare-ups!

My favorite turkey burger recipe from Epicurious makes the list! \"Goat cheese stuffed turkey burger\"&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s to love:&nbsp;Compared to a regular burger, a ground breast turkey burger has about half the calories and two-thirds less fat with similar protein content. I can feel good about having a burger more than once a week!&nbsp;
Cooking tip:&nbsp;Since turkey breast is so lean and can easily dry out on the grill, mix the ground turkey with a little goat cheese, lemon zest, breadcrumbs, and a seasoning blend, and then shape the meat into patties.&nbsp; 
How to eat them:&nbsp;Place the patty in whole-wheat pita bread with a little non-fat plain Greek yogurt, and top it with a mixture of jarred roasted red bell peppers and caramelized onions.
ENJOY! &nbsp;

Benefits to MOM

Maintain muscle, fitness level, and active habits to make labor and post-pregnancy weight loss easier.
Less likely to gain excessive weight.
Better sleep, more energy, better mood, prevent\/treat gestational DM, may relieve constipation, back pain, bloating, swelling.

Benefits to BABY

Stronger fetal &amp; lower heart rate (which continues after the baby is born)

If you follow these 3 key tips: RUN which stands for R: Regular, balance meals; U: Up the fluids; N: Nourish with microNutrients, you will cross the finish line of pregnancy and breastfeeding with a PR in nutrition!
R: Regular &amp; balanced meals
Eating often during pregnancy and breastfeeding helps with:

Nausea and feeling too full
Adequate weight gain. Recommended weight gain should be agreed upon between you and your doctor, but can be based on current BMI (body mass index)

Here is a summary of weight gain guidelines for a single&nbsp;baby&nbsp;based on your BMI:
If your BMI is less than 18.5: Gain 28 to 40 pound
If your BMI is 18.5 to 24.9: Gain 25 to 35 pounds
If your BMI is 25 to 29.9: Gain 15 to 25 pounds
If your BMI is 30 or greater: Gain 11-20 pounds

Strong workouts and avoidance of low blood sugars that can occur during exercise

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Never exercise on empty stomach. A carb-rich snack ~30 min to 1 hour before your run and carb + protein rich snack post run will help you recover and provide important nutrients to growing baby. &nbsp;My favorite pre run snack is a slice of whole-wheat bread with a thin spread of peanut butter, and post run is a slice of raisin toast with low-fat cottage cheese &amp; cinnamon.

Adequate calories for lactation and optimal nutrients &ndash; you are the sole source of nutrition for your baby. Some research has shown that a diet with less than 1800 calories will not provide enough energy for you and baby&hellip;and this does not include the extra calories for running!&nbsp;

U: Up the Fluids:
Upping the fluids during pregnancy and breastfeeding is vital! Fluids needs increase to assist with:

Prevention of overheating for you and baby
Increase in blood volume that occurs with pregnancy
Provision of enough fluids for breast milk production

How much? The Institute of Medicine recommends that pregnant women drink about 10 cups of fluids daily and women who breastfeed should consume about 13 cups of fluids a day. These recommendations do not account for fluids lost during exercise! Runners will need to drink extra water to compensate for the fluid loss. An extra 1.5 to 2.5 cups of water should suffice for short bouts of exercise, but intense exercise lasting more than one hour requires more fluid intake, and most also should include some sodium to assist with water balance.
Plain water is preferable, but coffee, tea, milk and juice count toward your fluid requirements, too. You&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re fully hydrated when you&rsquo;re urine is pale yellow.
N: Nourish with microNUTRIETNS:
Certain micronutrient requirements increase during pregnancy and breastfeeding and require a pre-natal vitamin be consumed for nutritional insurance. However, a supplement will never replace the benefits you receive from eating WHOLE food sources of these nutrients.
Here are key nutrients of focus:

Folate: necessary for the development of fetal nervous system and prevention of neural tube defects

Sources: fortified grains\/cereals, leafy greens, beans, lentils

Iron: needs nearly double during pregnancy to make blood for baby, athletes also have higher needs due to high turnover and hemolysis (foot strike).

Sources: Beef, poultry, pork, beans, spinach, tofu, fortified cereals

Calcium: development of fetus and protection of mothers&rsquo; bones

Sources: milk, yogurt, fortified non-dairy milks, tofu, leafy greens

Choline: like folate, also important for fetal nervous systems and baby&rsquo;s ability to learn and remember, and may protect against certain mental illnesses

Sources: egg yolks, spinach, potatoes, meat, fish

Omega-3 fatty acids: Omega-3s improve your baby&rsquo;s eye and brain growth and early development. Taking in enough omega-3s can lower your baby&rsquo;s chances of getting asthma and other allergic conditions. They also may lower your risk of giving birth too early, and of having depression after you have your baby (postpartum depression).

Sources: Fatty fish such as salmon or trout (avoid tuna during pregnancy), nuts, flaxseed, chia seeds 

Vitamin D: If you have low levels of vitamin D, you will pass those low levels on to your baby. Lack of this vitamin in pregnant women has been linked to diabetes and increased rates of caesarean section births, and babies can be smaller than average. Depending on which resource you reference, vitamin D needs can reach 1500-2000 IU per day during pregnancy, and vitamin D levels are often unmet through food. &nbsp;

Sources: Eggs, milk, fortified cereals, salmon, and UV exposed mushrooms
While these foods provide vitamin D in the diet, and you can also get vitamin D from the sun (esp. in the summer months) most women, however, need to take a supplement to optimize normal daily vitamin D needs.
In summary, this is a precious time in your life and one that will be gone in the blink of a 5K! If you take the time to nourish yourself, and be patient with your changing body, your energy can be allocated to your new bundle of joy and not the scale or your next PR.&nbsp;",

K-5: 550-650 calories 6-8: 600-700 calories 9-12: 750-850 calories
GRAINS: Following suit with the Dietary Guidelines,&amp;nbspat least 1\/2 of the grains offered must be whole-grain rich. Expect to see whole grain pizza crusts and burgers served on whole-wheat buns!
VEGETABLES &amp; FRUITS:There are two times as many fruits and vegetables offered, and schools now pay attention to color! Vegetables rich in colors, such as dark green and red\/orange and varieties of beans and starches must be presented on a weekly basis.
MILK: In the past, a child could choose from either skim, 2%, or whole milk. This year, schools will only include skim or 1%. Flavored milks, such as chocolate, will be available, but they must be skim.
SODIUM:There will be no changes to sodium requirements this year, but beginning in the next school year and the following years, reductions in sodium will be required and are based on the age of the child. As example, the sodium in lunch for a K-5th grade child will be limited to 1230 mg (2013-14), 935mg (2014-15), and 640 mg (2015-16) in upcoming school years.
FAT:The requirement for saturated fat remains the same and can make up no more than 10% of the meal&rsquo;s calories. Trans fats, on the other hand must be limited to 0 grams per serving.
The Brown Bag 
If you are a parent who will be packing a lunch 5x a week for 9 months, you might need some new ideas! Here are 15 healthy ideas from Web MD:15 Fresh Lunch Ideas,and for ideas to inject some fun into your kid&rsquo;s brown bag check out this:STL Moms Segment.
Packing a balanced lunch takes a bit of planning ahead, and if you include your child in the process, you improve the odds that his\/her lunch doesn&rsquo;t get traded! In addition, many kids have a short amount of time to eat. Pack a lunch that can be eaten quickly, i.e.: apple slices versus unpeeled orange. As you create your grocery list, think about small simple changes that can transform an old standby into something fresh and exciting that your kiddos will look forward to!

Did you know that &ldquo;gut bugs&rdquo; play a role in how much you weigh, how often you get sick, and whether or not stress aggravates your stomach?&nbsp;
The purpose of September&rsquo;s Nutrition Connection is to get the &ldquo;inside tract&rdquo; on what you need to know about the microbes living in your gut or your &ldquo;gut microbiome.&rdquo;
What is my gut microbiome?
The gut microbiome includes bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microbes living in our intestines. While one might assume that we would want to rid these microscopic microbes from our bodies, emerging research shows that our lives depend on them. The majority of microbes in our intestines are beneficial and essential to our health. These bugs have several roles in the body, which include metabolizing food and making vitamins.
How do the micro &rdquo;flora&rdquo; in my gut impact my health? 
Good gut flora:
1) limit bad bacteria by acting as a physical barricade and produce antimicrobial substances
2) support a healthy immune system
3) make essential vitamins including B vitamins (i.e.: B12) &amp; vitamin K
4) use calories from your food to make energy for liver &amp; colon cells
What is most interesting is the potential role of the &ldquo;micro flora&rdquo; in obesity, immune function and digestive health:
Obesity: Evidence shows that microbes play a role in how we burn calories and how much fat our body stores. Studies show that the gut bugs in obese individuals look much different from that of lean individuals. &nbsp;A study from Science Translational Medicine showed obese rats that underwent gastric bypass surgery had drastic gut bacteria changes. Their gut flora changed to resemble bacteria found in lean mice.
Even more promising, scientists transferred the altered bacteria into another set of obese mice that had not undergone surgery. These mice experienced rapid weight loss equal to 20% of the weight they would have lost had they undergone the surgery. Fascinating!
Immune Function: Your gut flora is the largest organ of immunity in the body. It plays a good defense by creating barriers to opposing bad bugs, and alerts other immune organs in the body (i.e.: lymph nodes) of harmful intruders.
Digestive Health: Studies show that people with normal digestive systems have different gut flora than those with digestive issues, such as inflammatory bowel syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome.&nbsp; We need more research to understand the relationship between the gut flora and these conditions, but altering your diet can potentially change the flora and improve symptoms.
How can I feed the good bugs to crowd out the bad ones? You scratch my back, I will scratch yours! The bacteria in your belly rely on what you eat to stay healthy, which in return, keeps you healthy as well. &nbsp;Their preferred menu choices include fiber-rich, fermented and cultured foods.&nbsp; If your diet falls short in fiber, you CAN alter your gut bacteria by eating their preferred fuel.
Where can I find fiber-rich, fermented, and cultured foods to feed my bugs?
Fiber: Studies have shown that individuals who eat more fiber have greater diversity of bacteria strains in their gut. Therefore, the recommendations for a healthy gut are in line with well-supported recommendations to eat a largely plant-based, high-fiber diet of fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains. I caution clients who seek out meat-based eating plans and strictly limit whole-grains and legumes from their diets (ah-hem&hellip;Paleo dieters.)
Fermented &amp; cultured foods: Fermented and cultured foods include sauerkraut, kefir milk, yogurt, aged and soft cheese (i.e. blue cheese or goat), miso soup, and tempeh.
Not so familiar with kefir or tempeh?

Kefir milk: Kefir milk tastes like yogurt, but has a thicker consistency. It is made from fermented milk, and comes in a variety of flavors. Enjoy it as a substitute for milk or yogurt in smoothie or as a recovery drink after a tough workout.
Tempeh: Tempeh is made from a base of fermented soybeans. It is an excellent source of vegetarian protein. Grill it or crumble it up and use as a meat substitute in spaghetti sauce.

What to look for in yogurt?
The yogurt aisle can be a true dairy dilemma! Because the gut bugs or &ldquo;probiotics&rdquo; in yogurt (and kefir milk) are not regulated, make sure to look for products that state they contain live and active cultures.
What are we still learning? We have barely scratched the surface when it comes to understanding our microbiome and its impact on our health.&nbsp; However, the ability to transform our gut flora through our food choices and subsequently improve our overall health is profound.&nbsp;

If menu planning always falls onto your plate, enlist support and round the troops! Ask each family member to \"research\" a new vegetable, and \"pinterest\" that veggie for recipe ideas! Involve your family in meal planning and engage them in age-appropriate tasks such as washing produce, seeding a squash or tossing cut vegetables in olive oil. Letting them participate increases the likelhood that your child will try new foods (plus you equip them with priceless lifelong skills!)
&nbsp;
The Pay Off: 
Choosing a variety of colorful, plant-based foods is the most efficient way of obtaining vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals that supplement companies promise can be acquired in their &ldquo;miracle capsules.&rdquo; For those seeking weight loss, research has shown that filling 1\/2 your plate with vegetables can help you feel full, without filling you out! Eating vegetables which are low in calories, yet high in water and fiber, is the ideal combination for weight loss.&nbsp;
Hopefully this newsletter will inspire you to fall out of your comfort zone and fall for these seasonal superfoods!&nbsp;
1. Spaghetti Squash What it is: An oblong, yellow squash, mild in flavor. If you don&rsquo;t care for squash, don&rsquo;t cross this one off your list! Its mellow flavor is the perfect base for spaghetti sauce. Once cooked, you will quickly see how the squash got its name. The stringy squash looks just like spaghetti noodles as you fork it out of the shell (let your kids try this!)&nbsp;
Nutritional resume: Spaghetti squash is a good source of eye protecting carotenoids, and provides only 42 calories per cup compared to 220 calories in a cup of pasta!

Recipe: Spaghetti Squash with Basil &amp; Cheese Ingredients:&nbsp; 1 cooked spaghetti squash 3 Tbsp. parmesan cheese 1 cup low-fat cottage cheese 1&frasl;2 cup sliced fresh basil Salt and pepper to taste Directions: Combine all ingredients while spaghetti squash is hot. Enjoy!

2. Fennel
What it is: Crunchy and slightly sweet, this vegetable&rsquo;s flavor profile is of licorice\/anise. Its bulb, stalks and leaves are all edible.


How to buy it: Bulbs should be clean, firm and without too many blemishes. There should be no signs of flowering buds that will tell you the fennel is past its time. How to store: Store in your produce drawer. It should keep fresh for about 4 days. 

Recipe: Pork Chops with Braised Fennel &amp; Caramelized Onions Yield: 4 servings Ingredients: 2 large fennel bulbs, trimmed and sliced 1 cup chicken stock 4 Tbsp. butter 3 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped 2 Tbsp. fennel seeds 3 Tbsp. olive oil 4 pork chops 2 large red onions, peeled and finely sliced Directions In a small skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-low heat and add the onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sweet and caramelized, about 25 minutes. In the meantime, combine the fennel, stock, butter, garlic, fennel seeds, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large shallow pan. Bring to a boil and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove the cover and continue cooking until the fennel is mostly soft but not mushy and the liquid is mostly evaporated. Adjust for seasoning to taste. To finish cooking, turn the heat to medium-high and cook off the remaining liquid, allowing the fennel to brown a little bit. In a third skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil. Season the pork chops and cook to desired doneness, depending on thickness, 3 to 5 minutes per side on medium-high. Remove the chops to rest, and add a splash of water to deglaze the pan. Pour the pan drippings into the fennel mixture. Serve the chops on a bed of fennel, topped with the onions. Source: Nibblous

3. Brussels Sprouts What it is: A cruciferous vegetable related to broccoli &amp; cabbage. 
Nutritional resume: Rich in vitamin K &amp; C, these mini cabbages are well known to protect us against certain cancers, and assist with our body&rsquo;s metabolic manager, the thyroid. 

Recipe: Honey Roasted Brussels Sprouts Ingredients:
1 1\/2 pounds Brussels sprouts 3 Tbsp. olive oil 3\/4 tsp. salt 1\/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper 
2 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar 
Drizzle of honey
Directions




Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cut off the brown ends of the Brussels sprouts and pull off any yellow outer leaves. Mix them in a bowl with all ingredients. Pour them on a sheet pan and roast for 35 to 40 minutes, until crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. Shake the pan from time to time to brown the sprouts evenly. 

4. Parsnips 
What it is: A root vegetable related to the carrot that is rich in vitamin C and fiber. Nutritional resume: Parsnips shine as a source of soluble fiber which helps lower cholesterol and keep&nbsp;blood sugars even. They're also a good source of folic acid, which reduces the risk of birth defects.&nbsp;
How to buy: Look for small to medium size parsnips with firm, unblemished skin for the sweetest flavor.

Recipe: Parsnip Fries Yield: 6 servings Ingredients: 2 1\/2 pounds parsnips, peeled, cut into about 3x1\/2-inch strips 
1 Tbsp. finely chopped fresh rosemary 
1 large garlic clove, minced 3 Tbsp. olive oil Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper 
1\/2 tsp. (or more) ground cumin 
Directions 
Preheat oven to 450&deg;. Mix parsnips, chopped rosemary, garlic, and oil on a large rimmed baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Spread out in a single layer. Scatter rosemary sprigs over. Roast for 10 minutes; turn parsnips and roast until parsnips are tender and browned in spots, 10&ndash;15 minutes longer. Crumble leaves from rosemary sprigs over; discard stems and toss to coat. Sprinkle 1\/2 tsp. cumin over. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and more cumin, if desired. 

5. Chickpeas 
What they are: Chickpeas (or garbanzo) beans are legume superstars. You have most likely enjoyed them as a salad topping off the salad bar or pureed as the main ingredient in hummus. Nutritional resume: One cup of chickpeas contains 270 calories, 13 grams of fiber, and 15 grams of protein. Canned will be the easiest way to implement these into your everyday diet. Look for no salt added brands or rinse under water to reduce sodium by 40%.&nbsp;

Recipe: Roasted Chicken with Italian Chickpeas 
Ingredients:
Yield: 4 servings
1\/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 4 garlic cloves, pressed
1 Tbsp. paprika
1 tsp. ground cumin 1\/2 tsp. dried crushed red pepper 1\/2 cup plain yogurt or Greek yogurt 4 chicken breast halves with bones 1 15-ounce can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained 
1 12-ounce container cherry tomatoes 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided

                        "searchable" => "Don&rsquo;t diet deprive:&nbsp; A skimpy diet will undermine your efforts to maintain your metabolically active muscle.&nbsp; Regular exercise and slight calorie deficits are more effective for weight loss than repeated extreme low-calorie diets. Yo-yo low calorie diets cause your weight to drastically fluctuate subsequently slowing your metabolism.
Timing trumps quantity: When it comes to maximizing muscle mass, not only do calories need to be adequate, but protein should be present as well. Higher protein diets (25% calories from protein) compared to lower-protein diets (10% calories from protein) may have a &ldquo;metabolic advantage.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, protein timing is key.&nbsp; Most people consume the bulk of protein at dinner, but your body can only use 20-30 grams of protein at a time.&nbsp; Spreading the protein love across all meals (15-30 g\/meal) and snacks (5-15 g\/snack) will optimize protein&rsquo;s ability to build and repair muscle.
Metabolic boosting foods? Unfortunately, there are no magical metabolism foods that will shed the pounds. However, some food ingredients might slightly boost metabolism after consumption, and every boost, albeit small, can help!

Green tea:&nbsp;Some studies show a small increase in metabolic rate after drinking green tea. Tea&rsquo;s combination of caffeine, flavonoids and the antioxidant, catechin, may not only help your body oxidize fat, but also offer a plethora of other health benefits. &nbsp;
Spice it up.&nbsp;Foods that contain capsaicin, such as jalape&ntilde;os, cayenne, and chili peppers, have been shown to raise your metabolic rate for about 30 minutes after you eat them. The boost is small&hellip;for instance it will not counteract an extra taco if you add hot sauce!

Metabolic boosting water? &nbsp;A 2003 study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that participants who drank more water&mdash;particularly cold water&mdash;showed a 30 percent increase in metabolism rate for about 30 to 40 minutes afterward. Dehydration has the opposite effect. Even slight dehydration may slow metabolism by as much as 3%.&nbsp; Drinking water also helps you feel more full and helps ensure you don&rsquo;t mistake thirst for hunger.
Add some fat. New and exciting research examining the different types of fat in our bodies, brown fat versus white fat, points to some promising ways to boost our inner fire. Brown fat, found in limited amounts in our bodies, actually burns calories compared to our &ldquo;lazier&rdquo; white fat cells. Chronic exercise can help convert white fat to brown fat, and colder environments can help activate brown fat.&nbsp; While more research is needed to examine brown fat&rsquo;s impact on our metabolic rate, the current information gives us just one more reason to exercise&hellip;and perhaps embrace this chilly winter!

However, spring marks a time when countless clients come to me frustrated that their increased exercise has led to weight GAIN! &nbsp;How could an increase in exercise lead to this? This month&rsquo;s blog addresses potential exercise &ldquo;pitfalls&rdquo; as well as strategies to get your eating and exercise habits in sync so that you can hit the ground running in the direction of your goals this spring!
4 Potential Exercise Pitfalls: 
1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eating is Easy, Exercise is LESS Easy. Most people would agree, it is &ldquo;easier&rdquo; to eat 100 calories than burn 100 calories through exercise! 100 calories adds up quickly when we grab a handful of M&amp;M&rsquo;s from the secretary&rsquo;s candy bowl or finish the French fries off our child&rsquo;s plate compared to the work it takes to burn 100 calories in a 30-minute gym workout.&nbsp;
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exercise-Induced Appetite.&nbsp; For many, exercise will naturally increase your appetite to eat. Whether or not we are aware of this appetite surge, we often respond by serving ourselves more, or grabbing an additional snack. Unfortunately, these small increases in food intake undo the calorie deficit we aimed to create.&nbsp;
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over-Estimated Exercise.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let them fool you, that elliptical or on-line exercise calorie calculator almost always overestimates how many calories you burn.&nbsp; These tools typically do not obtain enough personalized information to give you an accurate calorie count.&nbsp; Even though more sophisticated tools such as Garmin or Polar watches are more precise, they still are likely to overestimate calories burned.
4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entitlement.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve all said something of the following to ourselves at one time or another: &ldquo;I can splurge on X because I trained for X minutes today.&rdquo;
Making the Most of Your Exercise
1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do Exercise, Don&rsquo;t Diet.&nbsp; Exercising is a great way to lose weight because it doesn&rsquo;t slow your metabolism like cutting calories does.&nbsp; If you commit to a healthy balanced diet or make small calories cuts such as 100-200 calories per day, the weight should begin to come off.&nbsp; Significant calorie cutting has been shown to slow metabolism and therefore makes it both hard to lose and keep weight off.
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incorporate Interval Training. Interval training is a type of training that integrates short bursts of increased intensity into your workout.&nbsp; As an example, instead of walking at a constant speed of 3.5 mph on the treadmill for 4 miles, incorporate short bursts of jogging or faster walking at 5.0 mph every 5 minutes or so.&nbsp; Interval bursts can be incorporated into any type of exercise and will cause you to burn more calories and become stronger.&nbsp;
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-direct Your Focus: If you find yourself slaving over the elliptical machine or dragging yourself to Zumba class just for the sake of burning calories, pick another mode of exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Commit to physical activity that you will enjoy and look forward to doing.&nbsp; Choose to train for an event with a meaningful cause to you, such a 10K race, and surround yourself with others who enjoy and share similar goals.
4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move Beyond the Numbers. Focus on other benefits of exercise beyond calories or your weight on the scale.&nbsp; Monitor body fat and muscle mass changes by having your body composition tested.&nbsp; Commend yourself on the new definition you notice in your arms, or the smaller pant size you fit into.&nbsp; Enjoy increased energy and\/or better sleep. These are all worthy benefits of a commitment to being more active.

In this month&rsquo;s Nutrition Connection blog, we&rsquo;ll look at four ways journaling will improve your eating habits.
1. It will show you how much you are really eating.
Research has shown us time and again that we all tend to underestimate our portion sizes. In one study, Cornell University researchers spied on diners at an Italian restaurant via a hidden camera. Just five minutes after their meal, diners were asked how much bread they had eaten. Most people ate about 30% more than they thought, and 12% who were seen eating bread on camera denied having any at all! Journaling what you eat protects you against &ldquo;eating amnesia&rdquo; and helps you get in tune with portion sizes.
2. It clues you in to what works, and what doesn&rsquo;t.
When we record everything we eat, patterns begin to emerge and the connection between what we eat and how we feel becomes clear. For example, you might begin to realize a huge difference between the way a hearty oatmeal breakfast vs. a skimpy bowl of sugary cereal impact your mood and eating habits for the rest of the day. With the oats, you are full and happy until lunch, but with the cereal, you find yourself diving into the office candy dish by 10 am. This written reminder of food, mood, and hunger levels reinforces the behaviors that keep you moving toward your goals.
3. It provides accountability.
Logging your daily intake and receiving quantitative feedback is motivating for many, but the lesson goes beyond the numbers. Honest logging allows you to face potential emotional and mindless eating, and encourages you to &ldquo;pause&rdquo; before putting something in your mouth.&nbsp;
4. It gives you a black-and-white reminder of your accomplishments.
Another valuable feature of online journals\/apps is the ability to log daily weights. I encourage my clients to weigh often (weighing in the buff, first thing in morning, after using the restroom). While weighing daily might not be for everyone, the act of recording morning weights supports awareness and accountability. It is important to know that weight is affected by hydration status, glycogen storage (1 gram of carbohydrate holds on to ~3 grams of water), &ldquo;waste&rdquo; in your body, and hormones. It is very normal for weight to bounce between 1-3 pounds on a daily basis, so focus on weight trends over time. The visual of your weight trending in the direction of your goal provides an abundance of motivation and positive feedback!
You can't manage what you don't measure!&nbsp;
Journaling does not have to be a lifelong commitment, but it is especially useful when initiating a new eating plan or getting &ldquo;back on track.&rdquo; Embrace these savvy tools as an opportunity to learn and grow in your journey to good health!

Move over iceberg lettuce because this month&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nutrition Connection&rdquo; is going to inspire you to spruce up your everyday salad.&nbsp; If you build your bowl right, salad can serve as the starring role of your meal and leave you feeling well-fed. Follow these three strategies to assemble a salad substantial enough for supper.
1. Building the Base
Most salad bases begin with a leafy green. While it is tempting to reach for the same iceberg or romaine lettuce, &ldquo;lettuce&rdquo; us show you some green alternatives for a salad twist:
Arugula: (one of my favorites) peppery flavor, the bigger the leaf, the stronger the flavor
Endive: tangy flavor, nice to combine with other lettuces because of its &ldquo;leafy&rdquo; texture
Baby Spinach: earthy flavor, baby spinach tends to be bolder in flavor than its bigger leafed brother
Kale: earthy flavor and give this green a massage first&hellip;believe it or not massaging the green will enhance flavor and reduce its fibrous nature turning it into a luscious leaf (massage in lemon juice and avocado for an even tastier green)
Veggie Medley: the base of your salad is not limited to leafy greens. Any veggie combo will do the trick. Try chopped tomato and cucumber or saut&eacute;ed asparagus and snap peas.
2. Give your salad staying-power. 

Pump up the protein: Add lean proteins such as flaked tuna or salmon, shredded chicken breast, lean ground taco meat, hard-boiled eggs, marinated tofu, veggie burgers, roasted chickpeas or beans;
Add whole grain goodness: Cooked grains such as whole-wheat pasta, quinoa, or brown rice offer a fiber-full boost that will stay with you.
Flavor with fats: Fat-free is flavor-free! Plus, adding fats and oils to vegetables allow us to absorb more of the fat-soluble vitamins found in your colorful salad ingredients.&nbsp; Store-bought salad dressings are often disappointing. Freshly squeezed lemon juice and a good olive oil can be the simplest duo to dress a salad. For a basic vinaigrette, check out this month&rsquo;s Nutri-Bite. The &ldquo;dressing dilemma&rdquo; is one of the biggest barriers (and biggest salad sabotagers!) to making a tasty salad at home. If you crave creamy, try this month&rsquo;s dressing recipe. Beyond olive oil, add avocado, nuts and seeds (toasted are even better), flaxseed, chia seeds, and olives for healthy fats. &nbsp;
Dairy: Use pungent flavored cheeses such as goat, blue, gorgonzola, or parmesan to boost taste and enable you to use less&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fruits: Fresh, dried or canned, fruits such as dried blueberries, cherries, cranberries, mandarin oranges, strawberries, pears, or sliced grapes are a wonderful way to add a touch of sweetness with nutrients to boot

3. Some Like It Hot 
If you prefer a warm meal to end your day, you might think salad for supper isn&rsquo;t for you. Think again! Try saut&eacute;ing onions, broccoli, peppers, artichoke hearts (a variety of vegetables) in balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and some fresh squeezed orange juice. Add grains and proteins when they are still warm. Pile these on your leafy greens, toss it all up, and you have created a warm and comforting salad
Don't Fall for Salad Sabotage
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just have a salad&hellip;&rdquo; Trying to save your precious calories when dining out? While this might often be a good idea, don&rsquo;t fall prey to salad sabotage. Here are a couple of salads that are equivalent to the infamous &ldquo;taco salad!&rdquo;
Einstein Brothers: Bros Bistro Salad with Chicken: 940 calories
Macaroni Grill: Seared Sea Scallops Salad: 1,320 calories
California Pizza Kitchen: Thai Crunch Salad with Fresh Avocado:1,212 calories

Running has always been my sport of choice, but this summer I am transforming into a triathlete.

Not only will tri training make me a stronger wife and mom, it will make me a stronger sports dietitian.
What Will Always Remain The Same: 

Sound, practical nutrition recommendations you can trust.
Nutrition advice that meets you where you are and takes you where you want to go.
Dietitians who listen and care about what you care about.
Results that last for the long haul.",

Be a Weekend Warrior
Between birthdays, dinner dates, and family barbecues, an increase in calorie consumption is often inevitable on social weekends. Tip the balance back in your favor by upping your exercise too! With a little more slack in your schedule, add intensity or time to your normal workouts. &ldquo;Active-ate&rdquo; weekend events by putting them in motion. Try rock-climbing or hiking with friends instead of going to a movie, plan a family bike ride, or walk laps around the field at your child&rsquo;s sports games.
Splurge Smart
Most weekends are overflowing with splurging opportunities. Don&rsquo;t fall into the habit of weekday deprivation followed by weekend excess. Drop the &ldquo;last supper&rdquo; mentality and instead survey your weekend plans and consciously choose a splurge. Maybe it&rsquo;s an ice cream date with your kids or sharing your favorite dessert on date night. Planning your splurge gives you motivation to turn down those less-than-appetizing party appetizers and fully enjoy your chosen treat. If you do fall off the wagon, don&rsquo;t wait until Monday to get back on track. Start again with your next weekend meal or snack.
Continue Weekday Customs
Data from the National Weight Control Registry tells us that successful weight loss maintainers have similar eating patterns seven days a week. Make your weekends look more like your weekdays. Start Saturday and Sunday with your weekday breakfast smoothie, continue tracking your steps with a pedometer or logging in your food journal, or weigh yourself at least one day over the weekend. If your weekend plans take you out of the house, pack healthy snacks just as you do for the week. By keeping a few healthy habits in place, you&rsquo;ll be more aware of how your weekend affects your health and it will make it easier to resume your routine on Monday.
Set Yourself Up For a Successful Week
Weekends are not all diet danger zones, they are also the perfect opportunity to set aside time to plan ahead for the week. Schedule workouts, plan meals, and do some advanced prep for weekday eats. Wash and chop vegetables, cook whole grains and proteins in large batches, and portion out healthy snacks for grab-and-go. By investing a few hours of your weekend, you&rsquo;ll make a big investment in your health goals that you will benefit from all week!

A+ lunches are not only packed with nutritious foods, they also include foods your child actually wants to eat (and doesn&rsquo;t want to swap for his friend's chips!). &nbsp;
Here are 4 simple ways to create a healthy mid-day meal that also inject a little fun into your kids' lunchbox.
1. Kabob it.
Let&rsquo;s face it: food on a stick is simply more fun! Threading ordinary lunch items onto a kabob gives them a magical makeover. Here&rsquo;s some combination inspiration:

Peanut butter sandwich squares, banana slices, and strawberries
Bite-size pineapple and ham chunks
Tortellini, cherry tomatoes, and mozzarella balls

2. Shrink it.
Making mini versions of your child&rsquo;s favorite meals is a fun way shake up your lunchbox routine. It also makes the packing easier on you because tonight&rsquo;s dinner leftovers can do double duty as tomorrow&rsquo;s lunch. Bake your favorite meatloaf recipe in a muffin tin for mini meatloaves, try our mini egg bakes, or make the macaroni muffin recipe below. Bonus: these mini meals are freezer-friendly, so you&rsquo;ll always have a healthy lunch option on-hand.
3. Think beyond the bread.
If your kids are tired of the same &lsquo;ol sandwich routine, it&rsquo;s time to think outside the bread! Many healthy foods can serve as sandwich slices:

Slather peanut butter between two apples slices.
Slice a banana length-wise, spread with sunflower seed butter and freeze.
Spread hummus between thinly sliced carrots.
Smear pear slices with a spreadable cheese and wrap with sliced turkey.
Transform leftover pancakes or waffles into sandwiches with a smear of jelly and nut butter.
Combine refried black beans and cheese and spread on a whole-grain tortilla, roll-up and slice into \"wheels.\"&nbsp;

4. Get snacky.
Kids love finger foods, so crafting a lunch composed of bite-size nibbles will win their hearts and stomachs. Get lunch containers with dividers or use silicone cupcake cups and fill each section with snack-size portion. Some ideas: mandarin oranges, pretzel sticks, cheese squares, chicken chunks, red pepper slices, pickles, snap peas, popcorn, quesadilla wedges, mini bagel sandwiches. Dips are the perfect accompaniment to &ldquo;snack&rdquo; lunches and can enhance your child&rsquo;s willingness to chow down. Send salsa or black bean dip with cheese quesadilla wedges and peanut butter-yogurt dip with fruit. See the recipe below for a snack-sized kid favorite!&nbsp;

So what&rsquo;s the difference between the two brands&rsquo; hydration products? Here&rsquo;s the lowdown on the previously offered PowerBar Perform vs. the newly offered Gatorade Endurance:

Carbohydrate:

Compared to Perform, Gatorade is a less concentrated source of carbohydrates. But not by much. Gatorade Endurance is a 6% carbohydrate solution vs. 7% in PowerBar Perform. In other words, you get slightly less carbohydrate bang for your buck with Gatorade Endurance.
PowerBar Perform uses maltodextrin as its main source of carbohydrate, which is a larger carb molecule than sucrose (glucose + fructose), the sugar used in Gatorade. Smaller carbohydrate particles can mean more water in the gastrointestinal tract, a common cause of GI distress. You are likely in the majority who will feel great with Gatorade, but be sure to practice with products during training to eliminate the possibility of distress before race day!


Electrolytes:

Sodium content and type are essentially the same in Perform and Endurance.
Gatorade contains more potassium than Perform, which is not an issue.


Other ingredients:

If you&rsquo;re an avid label reader, you might be alarmed by some of the \"strange\" ingredients listed on the premixed Gatorade, but you can rest easy. These ingredients are simply emulsifiers and should not interfere with performance (see chart below for explanations).

                        "content" => "<p>Timing really <em>is <\/em>everything, especially when it comes to nutrition. From weight loss to fertility, and from nighttime sleep to daytime energy, the timing of the food you eat plays a strong role in your health outcomes. Follow these three timing guidelines and you&rsquo;ll be on schedule to achieve better health.<\/p><p>1. <strong>Shift calories to the light of day<\/strong><\/p><p>Studies suggest that eating the bulk of your daily food during the light of the day and tapering intake as the day ends helps to prepare your body for sleep. The key is to give your body energy at your most active time of day and to decrease that energy as your day comes to a close. Evening meals high in saturated fat are especially detrimental to sound sleep. High-fat meals disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it harder to drift off to dream land. Boost your breakfast, have a hearty lunch, and save snacks for the time surrounding exercise. Bonus tip: include serotonin-boosting tryptophan-rich foods like yogurt, pumpkin seeds, chickpeas, fish, and poultry in your evening meals to help soothe you to sleep. Read on to learn more about making this nutrient timing shift.<\/p><p>2. <strong>Eat breakfast like a king<\/strong><\/p><p>Multiple studies have shown that big breakfast eaters are more likely to lose weight and reduce their waistline circumference than those who eat a large dinner. And the benefits go beyond pounds and inches.&nbsp;People who eat like a king in the morning have better blood sugar control, healthier hunger hormone regulation, more energy for work and workouts, and sharper cognitive function. A bigger breakfast even seems to boost a woman&rsquo;s fertility. Women who shifted the bulk of their calories to breakfast saw a 50% increase in ovulation rate due to its positive impact on insulin sensitivity and hormone regulation. Make a plan in advance to make sure you eat breakfast even on busy mornings. Make a breakfast ahead of time like a batch of <strong>Pumpkin Protein Overnight Oats (recipe below)<\/strong> or <a href=\"..\/videos\/meal-in-a-minute-kale-egg-bake.html\">mini egg frittatas<\/a> and stash easy breakfast staples in your kitchen or at the office like containers of yogurt, hardboiled eggs, and packets of plain instant oatmeal.<\/p><p>3. <strong>Eliminate late-night snacking<\/strong><\/p><p>Late eating is a weight loss time bomb. People who eat late not only tend to consume more calories over the course of the day, but some studies show that late eaters are less likely to lose weight, more likely to carry more weight around their midsection, and have lower insulin sensitivity. As the sun sets and the day winds down, we are more susceptible to indulging in high-calorie comfort foods to sooth the emotions of the day. Adding insult to injury, late-night snacking is often done as a mindless activity- in front of our favorite television show, while we surf the web on the couch, or while standing in front of the refrigerator. Lower late-night snacking temptation by closing down the kitchen after dinner. Put away leftovers and turn out the lights to signal that the day&rsquo;s meals are done. If you must snack, make it mindful. Serve snacks in 1-cup snack bowls to control portions. Make your own snacking rules such as only eating a snack sans media while sitting at the kitchen table or eating a piece of fruit before serving a more indulgent snack.<\/p><p>Writtten by Kayli Dice,&nbsp;<span>MS, RDN, HFS<\/span><\/p><p><span>MNT dietitian,&nbsp;<\/span>blog:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.runonsunshine.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Running on Sunshine<\/a><\/p><p><strong>Pumpkin Protein Overnight Oatmeal<\/strong><\/p><p><em>Adapted from The Dashing Dish<\/em><\/p><p><em>Makes 2 servings<\/em><\/p><p>Ingredients:<\/p><ul><li>3 tbsp. pumpkin puree<\/li><li>1\/2 cup low fat milk<\/li><li>1\/4 cup plain low fat Greek yogurt<\/li><li>1\/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice<\/li><li>1\/4 tsp. cinnamon<\/li><li>1\/8 tsp. salt<\/li><li>2 tbsp. stevia or a drizzle of honey or maple syrup<\/li><li>1 cup old-fashioned oats<\/li><li>1\/4 cup protein powder<\/li><li>Optional: chopped nuts for topping<\/li><\/ul><p>Instructions:<\/p><ul><li>Mix all ingredients together until well combined.<\/li><li>Divide into two containers with lids and refrigerate overnight.<\/li><li>In the morning, enjoy cold or microwave 1 min. and serve warm.<\/li><\/ul><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

                        "searchable" => "Timing really is everything, especially when it comes to nutrition. From weight loss to fertility, and from nighttime sleep to daytime energy, the timing of the food you eat plays a strong role in your health outcomes. Follow these three timing guidelines and you&rsquo;ll be on schedule to achieve better health.
1. Shift calories to the light of day
Studies suggest that eating the bulk of your daily food during the light of the day and tapering intake as the day ends helps to prepare your body for sleep. The key is to give your body energy at your most active time of day and to decrease that energy as your day comes to a close. Evening meals high in saturated fat are especially detrimental to sound sleep. High-fat meals disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it harder to drift off to dream land. Boost your breakfast, have a hearty lunch, and save snacks for the time surrounding exercise. Bonus tip: include serotonin-boosting tryptophan-rich foods like yogurt, pumpkin seeds, chickpeas, fish, and poultry in your evening meals to help soothe you to sleep. Read on to learn more about making this nutrient timing shift.
2. Eat breakfast like a king
Multiple studies have shown that big breakfast eaters are more likely to lose weight and reduce their waistline circumference than those who eat a large dinner. And the benefits go beyond pounds and inches.&nbsp;People who eat like a king in the morning have better blood sugar control, healthier hunger hormone regulation, more energy for work and workouts, and sharper cognitive function. A bigger breakfast even seems to boost a woman&rsquo;s fertility. Women who shifted the bulk of their calories to breakfast saw a 50% increase in ovulation rate due to its positive impact on insulin sensitivity and hormone regulation. Make a plan in advance to make sure you eat breakfast even on busy mornings. Make a breakfast ahead of time like a batch of Pumpkin Protein Overnight Oats (recipe below) or mini egg frittatas and stash easy breakfast staples in your kitchen or at the office like containers of yogurt, hardboiled eggs, and packets of plain instant oatmeal.
3. Eliminate late-night snacking
Late eating is a weight loss time bomb. People who eat late not only tend to consume more calories over the course of the day, but some studies show that late eaters are less likely to lose weight, more likely to carry more weight around their midsection, and have lower insulin sensitivity. As the sun sets and the day winds down, we are more susceptible to indulging in high-calorie comfort foods to sooth the emotions of the day. Adding insult to injury, late-night snacking is often done as a mindless activity- in front of our favorite television show, while we surf the web on the couch, or while standing in front of the refrigerator. Lower late-night snacking temptation by closing down the kitchen after dinner. Put away leftovers and turn out the lights to signal that the day&rsquo;s meals are done. If you must snack, make it mindful. Serve snacks in 1-cup snack bowls to control portions. Make your own snacking rules such as only eating a snack sans media while sitting at the kitchen table or eating a piece of fruit before serving a more indulgent snack.

Slice oranges in half, and squeeze juice into tofu mixture.&nbsp; Using a zester or grater, zest orange peels into mixture. Once orange juice turns into a glaze, add chopped basil, balsamic &amp; apple vinegar, honey, soy sauce and salt. After basil has wilted, add the 2 cups cooked quinoa and 1 T. olive oil. Combine and serve!
OK, SO NOT EVERYTHING GOT DONE IN ONE HOUR...WHERE IS MY HUSBAND?&nbsp;

Pumpkin &amp; Sweet Potato Chipotle Soup
Serves 4: ~1.5 cup servings&nbsp;
Ingredients:

1 small whole pumpkin
1 large sweet potato, diced small&nbsp;
1 small onion, chopped&nbsp;
3 gloves garlic, minced&nbsp;
1 bay leaf, dried&nbsp;
1 t. cumin powder
1 t. garlic powder
1 t. chili powder
1 dried chipotle pepper
1 T. maple syrup
1 t. salt
32 oz. chicken broth (or vegetable broth)
1 T. olive oil
1 t. coconut oil
&frac14; cup half and half
Roasted pumpkin seeds for garnish

Directions:&nbsp;
Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees. Poke your pumpkin with a fork (cathartic cooking when child is not napping). Place pumpkin on a baking sheet and cook for one hour.
While pumpkin cooks, warm 1 T. olive oil plus 1 tsp. coconut oil in large saut&eacute; pan.&nbsp; Saut&eacute; chopped onion and garlic, until translucent.&nbsp; Add diced sweet potato and continue to cook for 10 minutes. Add 32 oz. of broth, bay leaf, cumin powder, garlic powder, chipotle pepper, and maple syrup.&nbsp; Cook on low to medium heat and simmer until pumpkin is baked. &nbsp;(This is your opportunity to multi-task ie: wash dishes, turn off distracting baby monitor, brush your teeth).
Once pumpkin is cooked and cooled slightly, slice pumpkin in half and scoop out seeds.&nbsp; If you are supermom, save the seeds and roast them to garnish the soup, I pressed the easy button, and used store-bought. &nbsp;With a spoon, scoop out all pumpkin pulp and put into soup mixture. Continue to cook 10 minutes longer.
Discard bay leaf and chipotle pepper. Use an immersion blender, blender or food processor and puree soup.&nbsp; Stir in half and half and top with pumpkin seeds.

Notes:
The use of chipotle was very subtle. Dial up the heat if you plan on feeding adult-mouths only.
Pumpkin: Could substitute two cans of pumpkin for one small pumpkin

Meditation and your health
According to research, meditation lowers blood pressure, alleviates depression, boosts immunity, reduces stress and anxiety, enhances memory and focus, and improves self-regulation. The combination of improved self-regulation with lower stress and stress-related hormones (cortisol) offer tools to deal with emotional eating. For those who know what to eat, but have a hard time making the best choice, meditation might be the ticket to help manage this emotional relationship with food.
How do you start?
Forget the lotus pose. There is no right or wrong way to meditate. The basic principles include sitting in a comfortable position, closing your eyes, focusing on your breath, and observing your thoughts without judgment. Start with 5 minutes a day and build up to a length of time that is sustainable for you.
When will you see tangible benefits?
Just like one workout won&rsquo;t give you bulging biceps, one meditation session will not change your life. Just like your body, your brain needs constant and consistent training. However, most mediators notice benefits of daily mediation in as little as two weeks. I immediately noted my practice working for me when I was able to respond versus react to my 3 year old&rsquo;s tantrums.
Did I peak your interest? Try it! I promise this small time investment will reap lifelong health benefits.
Other helpful tips &ndash; While I tried meditation on my own for some time, I found a guided mediation enabled me to maintain a more consistent practice. The mediation app &ldquo;Headspace&rdquo; was the ticket for me, but there are many mediation guides available.&nbsp;

Get over your fat-phobia! When we cut out all fats, we tend to replace them with refined carbohydrates (remember SnackWell&rsquo;s cookies?). This swap will not reduce your heart disease risk (and may even increase risk).
Foods rich in mono- and polyunsaturated fats like olive oil, canola oil, nuts, seeds and avocados WILL reduce your heart disease risk!
Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids found in fish, nuts and seeds are essential for health. (Check out the recipe below - you'll go nuts for 5 ingredient, NO bake heart-healthy bar!)&nbsp;
Based on the large body of evidence that supports saturated fat&rsquo;s link to heart disease, the American Heart Association recently REDUCED the recommended daily saturated fat intake to 5-6% of total calories.

Sorry butter lovers, your beloved butter is not making a comeback. Stick to healthy fats and these additional five proven strategies to protect your heart:&nbsp;

Avoid tobacco
Be active (aim for 30 minutes per day)
Aim for a healthy weight
Enliven your diet with more fruits, vegetables and whole grains
Drink alcohol in moderation (no more than one drink for women and no more than two drinks for men)

The other moral of the saturated fat story? Be careful when embracing nutrition advice from popular media. One over-sensationalized, &ldquo;bad science&rdquo; headline can spread like wildfire. Leave it to the experts (like your MNT dietitians!) to help you identify the nutrition advice worth embracing.

Optional step: Toast your oats in a 350 degree oven for 15-ish minutes or until slightly golden brown. Otherwise, leave them raw - I just prefer the toasted flavor.
Place oats, almonds and dates in a bowl - set aside.
Warm honey and peanut butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir and pour over oat mixture and then mix, breaking up the dates to disperse throughout.
Once thoroughly mixed, transfer to an 8x8 dish or other small pan lined with plastic wrap or parchment paper so they lift out easily. (A loaf pan might work, but will yield thicker bars.)
Press down until uniformly flattened. Cover with parchment or plastic wrap, and let set in fridge or freezer for 15-20 minutes to harden.
Remove bars from pan and chop into 10 even bars. Store in an airtight container for up to a few days. I kept mine in the freezer to keep them extra fresh, but it isn't necessary.

NOTES


*If your dates don't feel sticky and moist, soak them in water for 10 minutes then drain before processing. This will ultimately help hold the bars together better.

You likely already love a few meatless meals. Put these plant-based staples on the menu more often!

Breakfast for dinner: serve veggie-filled omelets and roasted potatoes.

Minestrone Soup with white beans and whole grain pasta. A hearty, filling one-pot meal!

2. Meatless meal makeovers
Take your favorite meat-based recipes and swap all or a portion of the meat for a plant protein source like beans, lentils, tofu or edamame.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few ideas:

Swap the beef in your stir-fry for cubed tofu
Grill black bean burgers instead of beef burgers

Whether you battle the occasional bad mood or have been diagnosed with clinical depression, the type of fats you eat can have a real impact on the health of your brain.
Clear evidence supports the need to enjoy more omega-3 fats, which can be found in fatty fish, like salmon, trout and tuna and to minimize foods rich in saturated and trans fats.
I am on a constant hunt for fish recipes that the whole family will love &ndash; and this Parmesan &amp; Pesto topping seems to currently be doing the trick (for at least 3 out of 4 family members).&nbsp;
Serve fish at least twice a week to keep both mommy and the rest of the family&rsquo;s brains both happy &amp; healthy.

April, the month we celebrate Earth Day, is the perfect time to talk about ways to reduce food waste. The healthy foods are usually the ones that end up in the trash. Strategies to extend freshness and repurpose will keep healthy foods out of the landfill and in your family&rsquo;s hungry tummies!
BREAD:
Keep it fresh: Store loaves of bread in the freezer for extended freshness. A quick pop in the toaster or a few seconds in the microwave revives that bread in seconds.
Repurpose: Convert stale bread into croutons by toasting in the oven with a bit of olive oil, salt and herbs. These croutons will last a couple weeks and can be tossed on a salad or soup.
FRUIT:
Keep it fresh: Buy in-season for the longest shelf life. In the summer, choose melons and berries. In the winter, focus on hearty fruits like citrus and apples.
Repurpose: Transform overripe fruit into fruit salad: slice, drizzle with honey and lemon juice, and place front and center in the fridge for an enticing healthy snack. Freeze overripe fruit, especially bananas, to use in fruit smoothies or for a frozen sweet treat.
VEGETABLES:
Keep it fresh: Instead of banishing veggies to the depths of your refrigerator&rsquo;s produce drawers, store them on the top shelf where you will see them&hellip; and actually use them!
Repurpose: You&rsquo;ve probably heard of &ldquo;snout-to-tail&rdquo; cooking (using all parts of the animal), but what about &ldquo;root-to-stalk&rdquo;? Parts of vegetables that usually end up in the trash are actually healthy and delicious to eat!

Peel cauliflower and broccoli stalks to reveal the tender, sweet core. Slice the peeled core into sticks for dipping or chop and add to a recipe along with the florets.
HERBS:
Keep it fresh: store herbs like fresh flowers- snip the ends and place in a glass of water. Cover loosely with a plastic bag and store in the fridge (basil is the exception, keep it on the counter). Change the water every few days (when it starts to get cloudy). Resist the urge to wash herbs ahead of time- wash right before use.
Repurpose: Chop up leftover herbs and mix with some olive oil, salt and pepper (sort of like a pesto).

Here&rsquo;s the truth behind three maternal nutrition claims:
Myth or fact? Meal timing can enhance fertility.
Fact!
Studies show that a bigger breakfast seems to boost fertility. Women who shifted the bulk of their calories to breakfast saw a 50% increase in ovulation rate due to its positive impact on insulin sensitivity and hormone regulation.
Myth or fact? Pregnant women should avoid seafood.
Myth!
Although mercury is a concern for pregnant women, very few fish types need to be avoided (King mackeral, tuna, shark, tilefish, and swordish). Low-mercury omega-3-rich fish like salmon actually offers key benefits to both mom and baby. Omega-3s improve your baby&rsquo;s eye and brain growth and early development.

Myth or fact? A mom&rsquo;s pregnancy diet can impact her child&rsquo;s food preferences later in life.
Fact!
Research shows that food flavors are transmitted from mother to baby through amniotic fluid. These flavors influence the baby&rsquo;s food preferences into childhood. In other words, you can help establish a healthy eater by eating a variety of healthy foods during pregnancy yourself!&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

In all cases of supplementation, you can&rsquo;t supplement your way to better health; foods must come first.&nbsp; This is particularly important in pregnancy.
For many women, fish oil supplements are more appealing for a few reasons: 1) she doesn&rsquo;t like fish, 2) family members don&rsquo;t like fish, 3) she is fearful of potential contaminants in fish, 4) she isn&rsquo;t comfortable cooking fish.&nbsp;

If you think you are a &ldquo;fish hater&rdquo;, I encourage you to try a few different varieties and cooking methods.&nbsp; While fattier fish, like salmon are higher in healthy fats, lower fat fish (with milder flavor) also offer benefits. Cooking techniques that might tempt your tastebuds (and make fish more palatable) include: breading and baking; baking in taco seasonings for fish tacos; baking in foil or parchment paper with other ingredients like tomatoes, olives, and basil; grilling and topping with fruit salsa; incorporating salmon into a salad with mayo, Greek yogurt, lemon and dill.&nbsp; For family-friendly fish, try breading and baking, grilling with fruit salsa, or serving with a dipping sauce.
Don't give up offering fish to your family, and certainly don&rsquo;t cut your own (and babies) needs short by leaving it off the menu!&nbsp;

1 small shallot
&frac14; cup fresh mint

&frac14; cup balsamic vinegar
&frac14; cup olive oil,
1 T. Dijon mustard
Salt &amp; Pepper

The third rebirth recipe was delicious, and the anti-food waster in me felt a real sense of accomplishment by not letting one drop of watermelon juice go to waste.

Light-exposed mushrooms are an excellent source of Vitamin D &ndash; a hard vitamin to come by naturally in food.

Our family meal ideas are often inspired by what we have left over in the pantry or fridge at the end of the week. This week, leftover coconut milk, ground chicken and mushrooms were transformed into Coconut &amp; Curry Chicken Lettuce Wraps. With the few days left in summer, I was craving something light and summery. In this recipe, bib lettuce is filled with a flavorful chicken &amp; mushroom combo that is light in sodium, sugar and fat compared to a similar order from P.F Changs.
Leaning on leftover mushrooms enabled me to extend the serving size, (~extending $&rsquo;s), punch up some plant-power, and boost the bone protective nutrient, vitamin D. With a recent stress fracture in my foot, I am upping my vitamin D and calcium intake. Light-exposed mushrooms are an excellent source of Vitamin D &ndash; a hard vitamin to come by naturally in food. While you can buy UV light exposed mushrooms, you can also let your &lsquo;shrooms soak up the sun outside (even in winter) for one hour and generate close to your daily needs of D in one cup of mushrooms!&nbsp;
*Another food boosting cooking technique: Chop garlic &amp; onions 10 minutes early.&nbsp; This allows the garlic and onions time to activate and retain their disease-fighting phytochemicals. Without this resting period, the heat instantly deactivates health benefits.

Here are three strategies for building a balanced breakfast and three grab-and-go recipes that will have you out the door to work or school in a flash.
Three Strategies to Build a Balanced Breakfast 
1. Aim for 3 different food groups 
While any breakfast is better than no breakfast, aiming for 3 different food groups ensures a variety of different types of fuel. More fuel and a variety of fuel translates to an overall reduced appetite and calorie intake the rest of the day. Two examples: Yogurt parfait with yogurt, fruit and fiber-rich cereal (dairy, fruit, whole grains) Whole grain toast hard-boiled egg and a banana (whole grains, protein, fruit)
2. Build in protein 
Eating a protein-packed breakfast helps you stay full and stabilize blood sugars, and may help maintain a healthy body weight. A recent study showed that teens who ate a protein-packed breakfast (about 35 grams) stabilized their blood sugar, reduced feelings of hunger and prevented unhealthy gains in body fat.
Protein-packed Breakfast Foods: 

1 cup of yogurt = 8 grams
1 cup of greek yogurt =22 grams&nbsp;
2 large eggs = 12 grams&nbsp;
2 T. peanut butter = 8 grams&nbsp;
1 cup low-fat cottage cheese = 28 grams&nbsp;
1 turkey\/soy sausage = 10 grams

3. Cut back on sugar
It is obvious that donuts and pastries are loaded with sugar, but many breakfast cereals and bars are high in sugar too. A sugary start will leave you and your child hungry within an hour, making concentration and productivity difficult. How to lower the sugar: Aim for a cereals that have 8 grams of sugar or less. Use fruit to sweeten foods. Top whole grain waffles with banana slices and stir berries into unsweetened yogurt. Balance out sweet with unsweet. Example: pair a hard-boiled egg with a sweet cereal bar.

Telomeres are the caps on the ends of our chromosomes that determine how quickly our cells age.
Here are four areas of your everyday life where you can implement time-slowing strategies.
1. Move Naturally
Most centenarians, people who live to age 100 and beyond, live active lives without ever stepping foot in a gym or on a race course. Their secret: they build activity into their daily lives by commuting on foot, gardening, and maintaining housework and yard work independently. Build activity into your daily life by commuting on foot when possible, turning social engagements into physically active meet-ups, and choosing the less-convenient route (get up to change the channel instead of using the remote, take the stairs instead of the elevator).
2. Adjust your outlook
Those who live the longest tend to have a positive, playful, and purposeful outlook on life. Take time each week for stress-reducing activities like walking with a friend, taking a break from technology, or meditating. Less stress means less inflammation, which translates to a lower risk of age-related diseases. Develop a life mission statement. Those who have a specific reason for waking up each morning ward off stress, stroke, and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Get clear on your reason for waking up each morning and remind yourself of this reason daily.
3. Eat wisely
Those who age well tend to eat a primarily plant-based diet. Edge out large servings of animal products by including at least two servings of produce at every meal, making beans a prominent part of your diet, and snacking on a serving of nuts once per day. Many Blue Zone cultures also make it a point to eat until they are 80% full instead of stuffing themselves to the brim.

A glass of red wine per day is also associated with a longer life, less stress, and lower rates of heart disease!
4. Build strong relationships
Loneliness can knock up to 8 years off your life. Centenarians prioritize family time over everything else, invest time in friendships, and belong to faith-based or like-minded communities. By cultivating strong relationships, they create reliable support networks. Make it a priority to eat a meal with your family once per day and make the effort to foster healthy friendships. This investment in relationships will literally pay you back in years of life!

It&rsquo;s taper time! With many miles of training behind you, there is no doubt you are mentally and physically prepared for your upcoming marathon. However, this &ldquo;tapering period&rdquo; often conjures up questions on how to adapt your diet in the days leading up to race day. How you eat can sabotage or support your months of preparation. The following nutrition strategies will support all your hard work.
General Diet Strategies for the Taper
After many weeks of long-distance running, you have likely grown accustomed to eating more! In addition, you may have enjoyed more &ldquo;splurges&rdquo; and sports nutrition supplements. Sports nutrition supplements tend to be sweet (sports beans, chocolate gels, etc.) and can dial up your desire for sweet foods! While there is little concern with weight gain during a short-term taper, here are a few nutrition considerations:

Build a Runner&rsquo;s Plate: The runner&rsquo;s plate should include produce on every plate, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats
Frequency: Eat every 3-4 hours to help reign in appetite and avoid overeating at one sitting
Reduce portions by ~20%: Research shows that we can eat 20% less without even noticing. This equates to serving yourself a few less tablespoons of food at every meal.&nbsp; Be cautious that cutting back TOO much can compromise training adaptations. &nbsp;
Produce prominence: Aim to fill &frac12; you plate with fruits and vegetables and limit the sweet foods that don&rsquo;t carry nutritional value &ndash; that means no need for sports supplements, energy bars, or post long run splurges.

Carb- Loading: Two Days Before Race Day
Studies show that eating a high carbohydrate diet in the two days leading up to race day can improve performance time, decrease time to fatigue, and boost mental and physical energy.&nbsp; The prescribed carb needs depend on your body weight. Research shows a benefit at 7-12 g of carb\/kg.
The best way to know how many carbs you are eating is to keep an online food journal like &nbsp;&ldquo;My Fitness Pal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lose It.&rdquo; Assess your average carb intake, and then aim to increase that amount two days prior to race day.&nbsp;
Here is an example:
Runner Dan: 180 pounds, currently eats 400 grams of carb on average
180 pounds divided by 2.2 = 82 kg
&nbsp;82 kg x 7 = 575 grams of carb
82 kg x 12 = 984 grams of carb
Runner Dan decides to aim for 600 grams of carb on Friday and Saturday leading up to his Sunday race.
If you already eat a proper &ldquo;athlete&rsquo;s diet&rdquo; with plenty of carb, an extra of 1-2 servings of carb at each meal is typically all you will need.&nbsp; Here are some simple ways to accomplish this:

Add a glass of orange juice to breakfast, and slightly larger portion of cereal.
Swap your sandwich thins for a whole grain bun at lunch &amp; add a piece of fruit
Eat two extra scoops of rice at dinner.
Add a sports drink to snacks.

Other Carb Considerations

Carbo-load, don&rsquo;t fat-load! To avoid taking in too many calories, decrease your daily fat intake to make room for carbs
Weight gain is normal. If you have carb-loaded correctly, expect to see a drift upwards in your weight of about 1-3 pounds. This is normal and desired &ndash; Your body stores ~3 oz. of water w\/ every 1 oz. of carb. Don&rsquo;t worry, you will run this off!
Choose SOME fiber, but not too much In the days leading up to the race, a boost in too many refined carbs may leave you constipated (especially without the foot strike!). You can still eat whole grains and fruits, but beware of high fiber foods like bran, beans, and broccoli!

&nbsp;Pre-Race Day Considerations:

Plan meal times carefully: NYC marathon queen Grete Waitz said she never ate a big meal the night before a marathon, but preferred to eat a bigger breakfast and lunch the day before. I encourage upfronting your carbs to avoid feeling TOO full or uncomfortable at the start line.


Remember the fluids: Drink enough to produce volume to void every 2-4 hours, but don&rsquo;t over-do it. Your body is a sponge, it can only absorb so much fluid, and you will dilute your electrolytes!


Befriend the familiar foods: Don&rsquo;t eat unfamiliar foods before race day. This is not the time to check out a new Indian restaurant or sample every gel or sports bar at the expo. 

Race Day Morning Meal
The purpose of the race day morning meal is to top off glycogen stores, start with a settled, yet comfortably full stomach, and steady blood glucose levels. One study showed that runners who ate 500-1000 calories a few hours before a marathon performed better than those that skimped. Breakfast should be eaten 3-4 hours before your race (this might mean you set an alarm, and go back to bed), and then a small carbohydrate containing snack 30 min to one hour before the race. The foundation of these meals should be easily digestible carbs with minimal protein and fat. Here is an example race-day breakfast:
Example 1:
3-4 hours before: Large bagel with thin spread of nut butter &amp; jelly, banana, sports drink
1 hour before: Banana
Example 2:
3-4 hours before: 2 cups of rice w\/ little salt and butter, 1 hard boiled egg, one banana, and sports drink
30 min to 1 hour before: 1 gu pack with water
Give homage to your race day plan, and reap the nutritional race day benefits!&nbsp;",

What makes something a trigger food?
Most trigger foods tend to be calorie dense- either from fat or processed carbohydrates. Beyond that common thread, trigger foods are widely subjective based on taste preferences, environment, and food memories. Cravings can be triggered by hunger, stress, environmental cues, as well as sights, smells and thoughts of certain foods.
How do these types of food affect your body and brain?
Trigger foods engage a different section of the brain than hunger or the desire for certain tastes does. For example, you might really enjoy bananas, but you likely don&rsquo;t reach for bananas when you feel stressed. Stress likely triggers other cravings.
Can you be addicted to trigger foods?
Yes, and the more we &ldquo;give in&rdquo; to our triggers, the stronger the imprint becomes. The good news is that you can retrain your brain and disentangle the trigger. Here are several ways to conquer your trigger food cravings.
How to manage trigger foods the healthy way
1. Feed your brain healthy foods, and do this consistently
You can change what your brain craves, but you have to teach it (and feed it right!) to do so.
To prove this, a recent study showed that individuals who made healthy diet swaps (like choosing whole wheat pasta over white pasta) were not only able to lose weight, but were also able to rewire their brain so that photos of the healthier swaps lit up the reward center of their brain just as trigger food would.This study suggests that a consistent healthy diet programs your brain to enjoy healthier foods, making it easier to turn down that chocolate chip cookie.
2. Get More Sleep.&nbsp;
While I am Registered Dietitian and not a sleep specialist, one of the first questions I ask someone who is trying to lose weight is how many hours of sleep they get each night.
In terms of cravings, one study showed that people who got 90 extra minutes of sleep reduced sweet and salty junk food cravings by 62%!
When it comes to weight loss and conquering cravings, give sleep just as much attention as diet and exercise.
3. Don&rsquo;t get &ldquo;hangry&rdquo;
Letting yourself get too hungry makes you much more susceptible to food cravings. Set specific meal and snack times, spaced out by about 3-4 hours, and try not to eat between these established mealtimes.
4. Keep temptations away &nbsp;
Keep triggers at bay by storing them in the basement, avoiding places where they might be lurking like the office break room or mall foodcourt, or by simply not bringing trigger foods home in the first place. Sight and smell are strong triggers that can leave you powerless to the last donut in the box.
5. Revamp your cravings
We tend to crave high-calorie foods. Some research shows that if you lessen the calorie density of the food, you can lessen your brain&rsquo;s desire for it. For example, I eat dark chocolate after lunch everyday, so now my brain has come to expect this treat. If I swapped my chocolate bar for a low-calorie chocolate pudding, eventually my brain&rsquo;s desire for that chocolate pudding would lessen, and I could more easily give up my chocolate indulgence all together.

I thrive on schedules, predictability, and sleep &ndash; all attachments you must quickly relinquish when you bring home a newborn.

Breastfeeding 10-12 times a day can really suck up some time (no pun intended). However, with this being my third go around, I have learned it is critical to be deliberate with daily habits to maintain my health, and here are 5 I am currently practicing:<\/p><p><strong>1. Nap<\/strong>. Just do it. Every experienced mom will tell you to nap when your baby sleeps, but seriously, ONE 30-60 minute nap a day will provide you with superpowers.&nbsp; You may struggle with the desire to clean up your kitchen or simply take a shower, but a little rest goes a long way. It helps you survive two-year old tantrums and bathtime bedlam.<\/p><p><strong>2. Re-enter the exercise world slowly<\/strong>.

Some days are better than others, but there are numerous days where the tears flow from sheer fatigue. I miss the energy a good nights sleep ensured. I thrive on schedules, predictability, and sleep &ndash; all attachments you must quickly relinquish when you bring home a newborn. Prior to Henry&rsquo;s arrival, I was proud of my established healthy habits that I call my health &ldquo;hygiene&rdquo; routine, which entailed:

Sleep: 7-8 hours of sleep a night
Nutrition: 2-3 weekend hours devoted to cooking
Physical activity: 45-60 minutes of activity 5-6 days\/week
Mental: One hour\/day dedicated to meditation, prayers, and reading&nbsp;
God Bless Henry, but he has hijacked my health hygiene routine. Breastfeeding 10-12 times a day can really suck up some time (no pun intended). However, with this being my third go around, I have learned it is critical to be deliberate with daily habits to maintain my health, and here are 5 I am currently practicing:
1. Nap. Just do it. Every experienced mom will tell you to nap when your baby sleeps, but seriously, ONE 30-60 minute nap a day will provide you with superpowers.&nbsp; You may struggle with the desire to clean up your kitchen or simply take a shower, but a little rest goes a long way. It helps you survive two-year old tantrums and bathtime bedlam.
2. Re-enter the exercise world slowly. As soon as I was released to exercise with my two past pregnancies, I raced out the door to get back into running shape. What I neglected, was the work I really needed prioritize &ndash; pelvic floor and core strengthening.&nbsp; With this third child, I have promised myself I will do nourishing activities which includes a daily, guided pelvic floor and core strength routine as well as a 30 minute walk &ndash; outside. While walking outside in December isn&rsquo;t exactly inviting, the fresh air is rejuvenating.
3.&nbsp; Eat.&nbsp; You might even feel pressed for time to simply sit down and eat. Mornings tend to be the most time-crunched meal, but smoothies pack in on-the-go nutrition that both Henry and I need. Blueberries are one of the most potent brain-boosting fruits, so I down this drink with a hope of a memory enhancing miracle:
Brain Boosting Smoothie:

Ingredients:

&frac34; cup light soy milk
1 T. ground flaxseed
1 T. nut butter
1 scoop protein powder
1 frozen banana
&frac12; cup frozen blueberries
2 cups spinach leaves
1 tsp. turmeric (potent anti-inflammatory spice that may protect brain)

Directions:&nbsp;Place ingredients in a blender and blend. Drink quickly before your children can ask you for some.
4. Lean on your freezer &amp; let go of high nutrition expectations.&nbsp; Fish sticks, chicken tenders, sweet potato fries, and vegetables have prime real estate in my freezer.&nbsp; Frozen foods are convenient, are equal in nutrition to their fresh counterparts, and simplify meal planning. I know I will be back into my weekend cooking routine someday soon, but for now, I am lowering my cooking bar, and my kids aren&rsquo;t complaining.
5. Accept the modified version: I miss my morning meditation session, but I have found that I can get in at least 10 minutes of uninterrupted meditation time while breastfeeding. Clearly, this doesn&rsquo;t replace the peaceful pre-baby morning time, but it does keep the habit alive.

Most importantly, remind yourself, remind yourself, remind yourself that you will sleep again like a normal person. Be deliberate about what your body really needs and honor it. Keep a gratitude list, I can easily go down the not &ldquo;enough&rdquo; road (sleep, time, energy), but am better served to focus on what I have plenty of &ndash; which is family, friends, and support.

Remember that if you increase your physical activity, it&rsquo;s common for your muscle mass to go up, your body fat to go down, and overall body weight to stay the same.

For the breadcrumbs, I used leftover cooked rice. I omitted the egg, subbed crumbled goat cheese for the parmesan cheese, and added roasted nuts for a crunch factor since I did not have crispy breadcrumbs.&nbsp;
I aimed to use similar portions of the ingredients, as well as following the recipe directions. The result was a totally tasty stuffed squash that I will make again &ndash; my way! Enjoy this kitchen creativity recipe in your home, and keeping trying on your own creativity hat!&nbsp;
Spinach &amp; Goat Cheese Stuffed Acorn Squash&nbsp;

Serves: 1 for main dish or 2 as a side dish
Ingredients:

1 acorn squash, halved, de-seeded
Olive oil
Salt &amp; Pepper
4 cups fresh spinach, coarsely chopped (any green will do)
2 cloves garlic, minced
&frac12; cup cooked rice (any kind, I had black rice on hand)
&frac14; cup goat cheese crumbed (any cheese will do)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.&nbsp; Lightly coat all flesh of the acorn squash with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. On a roasting pan or cookie sheet, place squash in the oven open side up and bake for 35 minutes.&nbsp; While squash is baking, in a saut&eacute; pan, warm 1 T. olive oil. Saut&eacute; garlic and spinach. After spinach has wilted, add rice and goat cheese until combined.&nbsp;
Fill the baked squash with spinach filling. Pack the filling into the squash. Feel free to mound the filling over the squash. Put stuffed squash in the oven and cook an additional 15 minutes. Remove from oven and enjoy!&nbsp;",

Once Questioners believe that a particular habit is worthwhile, they&rsquo;ll stick to it&mdash;but only if they&rsquo;re satisfied about the habit&rsquo;s soundness and usefulness. They resist anything arbitrary or ineffective; they accept direction only from people they respect.

Identify your &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind each habit. By anchoring a new habit to a reason you find important (ex: have more energy to play with my kids, feel), you&rsquo;ll be more likely to practice it.
Do your research. Evidence and facts help strengthen a questioners habits. For example, reading the research behind sleep and productivity will help a questioner stick to healthy bedtime habits.

Obliger
Obligers may find it difficult to form a habit, because often we undertake habits for our own benefit, and Obligers do things more easily for others than for themselves. For Obligers, the key to forming habits is to create external accountability.

Share your health goals. Sharing your goals with family, friends, and co-workers will help you enforce desired habits. If co-workers know you want to eat healthier, it will be easier for you to resist the office candy dish.
Enlist an exercise buddy. Knowing that a friend is counting on you to join them for a walk will help you stick to an exercise routine.

Rebel
Rebels resist all expectations, outer and inner alike. They tend to resist habits, but they can embrace habit-like behaviors by tying their actions to their choices and their identity.

Give yourself a lot of choices. To a rebel, choice = freedom. A rebel might be more likely to exercise if they belong to a gym with many group exercise classes to choose from.
Take it one day at a time. Rebels are more likely to keep a habit if they tell themselves they only have to do it today vs. for the rest of their lives.

Why is it important to teach mindful eating to our children?&nbsp;
When kids or adults practice mindful eating, we are more likely to eat the right amount of food, enjoy our food, and engage in less emotional eating. Mindful eating doesn&rsquo;t mean snail pace mealtime as we ooh and ahh over every bite, it simply means that we are more present and in the moment.&nbsp;
1. Role model mindfulness.&nbsp;As we know, our children learn primarily from us. If our ultimate goal is to take a seat while eating, put food on a plate, and power down the phone - they are more likely to do the same. No doubt there will be the occasional meal on wheels or stand up snack, but carving out \"you\" time at meal time is a nourshing practice.&nbsp;Savoring your food for just a few seconds more will result in pushing away from the plate feeling emotionally and physically satisfied.
2. Power down at mealtime. Turn off the TV&rsquo;s and phones. Even a distracting text beep or notification alert can be just enough to interrupt the flow of mealtime conversation. Leave the technology in another room.&nbsp;
3. Teach descriptive talk. In our family, I try to teach my boys to use different words outside of \"yucky\" or \"gross\" to describe what they don't like. If my 4 year old tells me something is yucky, I ask him why &ndash; is it too sour, crunchy or tough? Encouraging children to describe their food helps them tune into their senses and be mindful. Plus, you might find out that they don't like the \"crunch\" of apples, but they do like the flavor and offering dried apples is the perfect substitution!&nbsp;
4. They decide how much. As parents, we are in charge of WHAT a child is served, but they should be in charge of HOW MUCH. I encourage \"adventurous\" eating by requesting they try at least one bite of everything on their plate, but beyond that, forcing food sets up an unhealthy relationship with it.
Try these simple strategies at home to \"savor\" more. You might be surprised that small changes make a big difference in your family's enjoyment of eating.&nbsp;

Sip smarter
About &frac12; of the added sugars in our diets are coming from sugar sweetened beverages like soft drinks, fruit drinks, sweetened coffee and tea, energy drinks, alcoholic drinks, and flavored waters. A 12-ounce soda contains a whopping 10 teaspoons (40 grams) of sugar!

Go plain jane
Choose the plain, unsweetened version of packaged foods and add in your own sweetness with fruit, honey, or maple syrup. Add sliced banana to plain cereals, maple syrup to regular oats, or apple sauce to plain yogurt. For example plain oatmeal has less than 1 grams of sugar compared to a maple sugar oatmeal with 13 grams (3 tsp.) of added sugars
Savor the sweetness of Mother Nature
The naturally occurring sugar &amp; sweetness in fruit is not something you need to worry about since these sugars come packaged in a bundle of beneficial nutrients! Satisfy your sweet tooth with fresh berries, frozen grapes, or dates stuffed with a scoop of peanut butter and a pinch of cinnamon. For a decadent, chocolatey treat, try this Cocoa-Avocado Mousse!

That number is astounding and means that you or someone you know is likely trying hard to conceive without success. It&rsquo;s a mind-blowing punch to your self-esteem when you realize you are the 1 in 8. You wonder where you went wrong, what you could have done differently and how in the world this could happen to you. Once you&rsquo;ve been diagnosed, you can leave the doctor&rsquo;s office feeling totally lost and completely alone.<\/p><p class=\"Default\">But, you&rsquo;re not! Nope! In fact, far from it. We are everywhere. Most of us struggling is silence, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way. Support groups exist everywhere. In fact Resolve, a non-for-profit organization, helps make our community smaller. We encourage you to find local support through them.<\/p><p class=\"Default\">Then, come and hang out with us! We are two registered dietitian nutritionists going through exactly what you&rsquo;re going through. In other words, &ldquo;we get it!&rdquo; We know how crazy your life feels right now and we know you need all of the support you can get. Besides lending our moral support, we&rsquo;re also sharing awesome information in our Fertility Friday and Fertility Features on our websites. This information has a strong nutritional component because from what we know as dietitians, nutrition matters! In fact, research supports it! And how can you argue with the simple fact that when you are nourished, you feel amazing, powerful and more in control!?<\/p><p class=\"Default\">Now, let&rsquo;s talk food! What you eat matters, because like we said, being nourished helps prime your body for conception. Also, research points to certain foods that actually may help boost male and female fertility.<\/p><p class=\"Default\">Want to learn more? We thought so! Follow the links below to read how mushrooms and full-fat dairy may help boost fertility. And don&rsquo;t forget to follow our Fertility Friday Series and Fertility Feature Series.

One in 8 couples struggle with infertility. That number is astounding and means that you or someone you know is likely trying hard to conceive without success. It&rsquo;s a mind-blowing punch to your self-esteem when you realize you are the 1 in 8. You wonder where you went wrong, what you could have done differently and how in the world this could happen to you. Once you&rsquo;ve been diagnosed, you can leave the doctor&rsquo;s office feeling totally lost and completely alone.
But, you&rsquo;re not! Nope! In fact, far from it. We are everywhere. Most of us struggling is silence, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way. Support groups exist everywhere. In fact Resolve, a non-for-profit organization, helps make our community smaller. We encourage you to find local support through them.
Then, come and hang out with us! We are two registered dietitian nutritionists going through exactly what you&rsquo;re going through. In other words, &ldquo;we get it!&rdquo; We know how crazy your life feels right now and we know you need all of the support you can get. Besides lending our moral support, we&rsquo;re also sharing awesome information in our Fertility Friday and Fertility Features on our websites. This information has a strong nutritional component because from what we know as dietitians, nutrition matters! In fact, research supports it! And how can you argue with the simple fact that when you are nourished, you feel amazing, powerful and more in control!?
Now, let&rsquo;s talk food! What you eat matters, because like we said, being nourished helps prime your body for conception. Also, research points to certain foods that actually may help boost male and female fertility.
Want to learn more? We thought so! Follow the links below to read how mushrooms and full-fat dairy may help boost fertility. And don&rsquo;t forget to follow our Fertility Friday Series and Fertility Feature Series. Both designed to give you confirmation that you are not alone!
